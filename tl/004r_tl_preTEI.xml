<head>Varnish of <m>spike lavender oil</m></head>
<ab>One needs to heat <m>lavender spike oil</m> and as it begins to simmer, put in powdered <m>sandarac gum</m> so that it soon melts. And over a <m>charcoal</m> fire stir continuously until the <m>sandarac</m> is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said varnish on a <tl>plate</tl>. And if it is fatty when you handle it with a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>, it is ready. And for one lb. of <m>lavender spike oil</m>, you will put five ounces of ground <m>sandarac</m>, although some only put in four ounces, but this is not so good nor so fatty. This one is promptly dry. <pro>Framemakers</pro>, to avoid the trouble of polishing their <m>ebony</m>, varnish it with this, as do <pro>guitarmakers</pro>. This is not as appropriate for panels as that of pure <m>turpentine</m>, though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not used to varnish the landscape of a panel when <m>linseed varnish</m> was in use, because it would have yellowed the landscape. But with that of <m>turpentine</m>, one varnishes everything. You can put in powdered <m>sandarac</m> drop by drop Instead of , you can add to it pulverized <m>mastic</m> or otherwise, and it will dry more quickly.</ab>
<ab>If you want to varnish <m>plaster</m> or a wall, first put on your <m>glue de retaille</m>, very hot, because if cold it would not penetrate the wall at all.  And when you would have put your varnish on, it would come off.</ab>

<m>Aspic oil varnish</m> is not as apt for colors as that of <m>turpentine</m>, because <m>aspic oil</m> eats the colors, since it is too penetrating.</ab>

<head>To remove varnish from an old panel painting that has yellowed and varnish it again</head>


<ab>Take some <m>white soap</m> and <m>ashes</m> strained through a <tl>sieve</tl>, and soak all together in <m>water</m>. And with a <tl>sponge</tl>, take some of the said <m>ashes</m> and <m>soap</m> and rub the painting with it. And when you see that the old varnish has been taken off, throw a bucket of <m>water</m> at the painting to clean it, then leave it for a quarter of an hour in the sun to dry and revive the colors. Once your painting is dried, you can apply your <m>turpentine varnish</m>.</ab>

Make sure the colors do not come off.</ab>
