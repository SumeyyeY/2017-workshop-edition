<head><m>Damask Cloth</m></head>


<ab>You can make <m>damask cloth</m> of two different colours and imitate embroidery without adding anything else to it, as follows. Once it is is <m>dye</m>d yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you. Then you will sew some <m>string</m> or a bigger <m>cord</m> loosely onto the pattern and throw it into a <m>dye</m> of <m>woad</m> or <m>pastel</m> and it will become green, except that which is beneath the <m>string</m>, which will remain yellow because the <m>green dye</m> will not have penetrated there. And you can do the same with other colours and, instead of <m>string</m> or <m>cord</m>, add some pieces of poor quality <m>cloth</m> cut in Moorish shapes on top of the first colour. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.</ab>

<head>Casting <m>metals</m></head>


<ab>Candlesticks and small works are cast in a <tl>frame</tl> with sand. And after having imprinted the work, sprinkle the frame with <m>flour</m> in order to make the  <del>e metal</del> <m>copper</m> or <m>latten</m> run better. When the sand has been used for a month, it is necessary to take some new sand, because the one that was used, having been reheated <del>in fire</del> <figure>+</figure>, dries out &amp; loses its ability to bond. However, it is used to mix with the new sand, for it makes the work not so porous. Large works such as artillery, bells and similar things are cast in <m>earth</m>, and <m>copper</m> cast in <m>earth</m> makes less of a <fr>chappe</fr>, and is whiter than the one cast in sand. The <m>earth</m> is <m>sandy clay</m> mixed with <m>horse dung</m> and <m>cloth</m> waste. The <m>earth</m> that <del>is</del> has been used for casting, which is black, baked and as if burnt, is used to cast, mixed with artificial sand, and is very good. To soften and make the <m>copper</m> run, throw in, once it is melted, a little <m>lead</m>, which does not form an alloy but is found on the surface of the cast.</ab>

<head>Casting <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m></head>


<ab>The sand must be from something very dry and arid and reheated well in the frame, because, if it were humid, like <pro>founder</pro>'s sand, the <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m> would spatter, and cause damage. It is also necessary for the <m>earth</m> to absorb the <m>metal</m>, for cast <m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m> <del>is</del> become very spongy. That is why it must be beaten again, otherwise it is brittle, as one sees in spoon handles.</ab>
