<ab>The best, fattest and softest, is brought from <pl>Germany</pl> and is not in <fr>saulmon</fr>, but in <fr>lattes</fr>, of around an <ms><bp>arm</bp></ms> long and three <ms>fingers</ms> wide. It is brought to <pl>Lyon</pl> and they use it in <pl>Nuremberg</pl> to make the leaves for small mirrors.</ab>

<ab>They also make their <tl>molds</tl> out of <m>metal</m> which last longer and cast more precisely than <m>earthenware</m>, because the vessel is cast smoothly and evenly. But this is for the <pro>rich</pro> because a <tl>mold</tl> costs fifteen or sixteen <cn>francs</cn>. These <m>metal</m> molds are usually made for basins and ewers and salt cellars and similar things which are figurated.</ab> 


<ab>For pints, <tl>molds</tl> are made with <m>white clay</m> mixed with <m><al>horse</al> dung</m> and <m>wool</m> and well beaten. Because the pints are deep half-circles, they will not be easily removed from the <tl><m>earthenware</m> moulds</tl>, unlike the <m>clay</m> ones, which are softer.</ab>


<ab>Vents [souspirals] are made to <tl><m>metal</m> molds</tl>, and we cast all at once, so that there is no smoky black line in the middle of the dish which comes from the <m>metal</m>'s steam and smoke when it is casted. This means that in that particular spot, the work is knotted and very often pierced. However they can fix this by soldering, as I have said. This smoke is found in the middle right half of the cast, and in <tl><m>earthenware</m> molds</tl>.</ab>


<ab>The vessel can be hammered so that it will sell better, but it will not last as long.</ab>


<ab>Depending on the size of their dishes and plates, they have natches on the spoke of their <m>iron</m> wheels. And when they want to apply</ab>
