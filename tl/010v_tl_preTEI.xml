<head>For painting in <m>oil</m> on <m>taffeta</m> without the <m>oil</m> running</head>


<ab>A layer of <m><fr>batture</fr></m> needs to be made, which is made <del>of well cooked honey and turpentine</del> of <m><fr>colle forte</fr></m> soaked for 24 hours in <m>water</m> then gently bring to the boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little <m>honey</m> to soften it, and let it boil all together. And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in <m>oil</m>, which will soften the layer even more, and which can also serve to make a ground layer for <m>gold</m>. <m>water of alum</m> also keeps <m>oil</m> from running.</ab>

<head>For whitening <m><fr>ceruse</fr></m></head>


<ab>Hard-boil <m>eggs</m>, divide them in half and take the <m>yolk</m> out, and between the two halves of the <m>white</m> put a piece of <m><fr>ceruse</fr></m>, and tie them together with thread. Then boil in clear <m>water</m>, and it will become entirely black, and thus the <m>ceruse</m> will be purified. Some reheat it over fire and it becomes very white.</ab>
