<ab>This <tl>vessel</tl> is used to make large quantities of <m>turpentine oil</m>, that is to say a bucket an hour. And no matter if it is regular or high-quality <m>turpentine</m>. Low fire is needed, as you know, at the beginning. And always keep cold <m>water</m> in the cooler on the top. The lb. is sold at xii s{ols}, and at the bottom of the <tl>vessel</tl> remains the <m>colophony</m>, known as <m><la>pix graeca</la></m>. <m>Spirits</m> are also made well in this <tl>vessel</tl> and there is no need to distill it again. You do not need a <tl>stove</tl> for this <m>copper</m> <tl>vessel</tl>, but only <m>charcoal</m> around it if it has a flat bottom, but if it is round, you will place it on a <tl>trivet</tl>.</ab>

@ It is better to heat the <m>varnish</m> a little bit, rather than to put it out in the sun, because this makes the panel warp.</ab>

@ Some say it is not good to distil in this <m>copper</m> <tl>vessel</tl> because it is made green. However, when <m>tinned</m>, it is good.</ab>

<head>For varnishing</head>
<ab><m>Turpentine</m> <m>varnish</m> does not need any <m>glue</m> because it is fat and viscous and it is not absorbed in the <m>wood</m> like that of <m>spike lavender</m>  and <m>sandarac</m>. Also, that of<m>spike lavender</m> does not require any <m>glue</m> on <m>iron</m> and similar materials that do not absorb, but on <m>wood</m> and on <m>colors</m> which <del>have</del> <add>do not have</add> <m>gum</m> or <m><fr>colle de destrempe</fr></m>, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said <m>glue <fr>de retailles</fr></m> and to let it dry and to varnish.</ab>
