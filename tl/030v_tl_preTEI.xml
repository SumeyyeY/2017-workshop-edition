<ab>any bowl or plate, they enlarge and break with the strike of a <tl>hammer</tl> the <m>iron</m> wedges that has play in the spokes of the <tl>wheel</tl>. And, because they are on the notches and points where they should be, they tighten the aforementioned wedges [by] striking them with the <tl>hammer</tl>.</ab>


<ab>When their plates or bowls have been cast, soldered if needed, and purged anew of the burrs around with the hot <tl>soldering iron</tl>, and then with a big <tl>file</tl>. They adapt it on the <tl>wheel</tl>, and first of all wrap their kind of <tl><fr>esgrusouer</fr></tl> with a <tl>rope</tl>, as thick as the <ms><bp>little finger</bp></ms>, and lean it firmly on the <tl>crossing bar</tl> to secure it well. And while somebody else quickly turns the <tl>wheel</tl>, they guide the sharp edge of the <tl><fr>esgrusouer</fr></tl> by <bp>hand</bp> towards the edge of the round hollow, and gently guide it all the way to the center of the circle. And this <tl><fr>esgrusoue</fr></tl> is for removing the first rough and lumpy burrs of the work. And then, they unite it with a <tl>cutting <m>iron</m></tl> called a plane, the sharp edge of which they rub with a bit of <m>putty</m> on <m>leather</m> nailed with a piece of <m>wood</m>. And this in such a way that the flesh or flower is on the outside, because if the sharp edge of this <tl>plane</tl> was not rubbed and polished, it would not burnish and polish the <m>tin</m>, which would remain white instead of black and polished as a mirror. Moreover, they repair with this <tl>plane</tl> for the second time the work as they did with the <tl><fr>esgrusouer</fr></tl>. Then, with a <tl>knife</tl> or other <tl>cutting <m>iron</m></tl>, they scrape the edges of the plates or dishes to smooth them so that they do not get cut while handling them.</ab>
