<ab>They think the best <m>tin</m> is the one that comes in <fr>saulmon</fr>, which has not been remelted ever since it came from the <env>mine</env>, because the <pro>masters</pro> remelt it in <fr>grille</fr>, weighing two or three <ms><fr>lb</fr></ms>, to easily cut it and sell it by the piece. And in this they often mix in left-overs from <fr>plats</fr> of <m>soldering</m> and <m>common tin</m>. And to recognise the best one, it is the most lustrous, which looks burnished, because it is the softest. Sometimes in their <fr>saulmons</fr> they find pieces of <m>iron</m>, stones, or similar troublesome things, to cheat on the weight. The <m>tin</m> from <pl>England</pl> is so hard that the <pro>miners</pro> put in <m>lead</m> to soften it. The one that comes by way of <pl>Germany</pl> is softer. Usually, the <pro>master pewterers</pro>, sworn in to the <env>good cities</env>, add 6 or 8 <ms>pounds</ms> of fine <m>lead</m> to a <ms>quintal</ms> of fine <m>tin</m>. The <pro>others, who work in the <env>fields</env></pro>, add fifteen or twenty or as much as they can, and to disguise the darkness and the softness of the <m>lead</m>, they put in <m>looking-glass tin</m>, 4 <ms>lb.</ms> per <ms>quintal</ms>, <figure>+</figure>, which whitens and hardens, and six or height <ms>lb</ms>. of <m>rosette</m>, to give the plate <sn>a good ring</sn>. </ab>


<ab>
To cast platters and plates, they make them out of <fr>pierre morte</fr>, that is from <m>gr√®s</m>, and they form and polish them on the wheel. They melt their <m>tin</m> in an <tl><m>iron</m> posnet</tl> on a <m>charcoal</m> fire, and with an <tl><m>iron</m> spoon</tl> that holds the quantity sufficient for a platter, they cast in their <tl>cold molds</tl>, which they keep joined and squeeze between their <bp>knees</bp>. Soon, they open the <tl>molds</tl> so that they do not heat up, and having taken out the casting which is on the female side, and which breaks easily. Then, with a <tl>piece of cloth</tl> soaking in <m>water</m>, which they always have at hand, they rub the middle of the back side of the plate and around the edge, so that it comes out better, and they rub the female mold with it.</ab>

When the <m>tin</m> is fine, one adds less <m>glass-looking tin</m> to it, that is 4 <ms>lb.</ms> per <ms>quintal</ms>, but if the <m>tin</m> is low<sup>-quality</sup>, that is allied with a lot of <m>lead</m>, one adds at least five or six <ms>lb.</ms> of <m>looking-glass tin</m> to it.</ab>
<ab>
If there is not a lot of <m>looking-glass tin</m>, one adds about two or three <ms>lb.</ms> per <ms>quintal</ms>. One adds eight <ms>lb.</ms> of <m>rosette</m>. But if there is a lot of <m>looking-glass tin</m>, about 4 or 5 <ms>lb.</ms>, one only adds six of <m>rosette</m>. And commonly, for one <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>tin</m>, one adds x <ms>lb.</ms> of both.
