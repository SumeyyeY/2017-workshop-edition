## <span class="m">Varnish</span> for lutes

 
They take a little <span class="m">turpentine</span> and some <span class="m">turpentine oil</span>, or <span class="m">spike lavender [oil]</span>, and some <span class="m">amber</span> pulverized and very finely sieved & proceed as with that of <span class="m">mastic</span>, & they add some <span class="m">dragon's blood</span> to color it and turn it red. And others some <span class="m">terra merita</span> to turn it yellow.
 
 
  

## Borders for a Garden

 
You have to work the ground, then then it with a rake, and afterwards if it is dry you must <span class="m">wet</span> it. Then stretch a cord clean on the ground, and along its length hit the cord with the back of a pruning knife, so that the cord marks a right line. Along its length you will make holes with an <span class="m">iron</span> stake, where you will plant rosemary, its head lopped off & cut to measure and thinned out at the foot.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Locksmith</span>

 
To <span class="m">tin</span> nails and other work, they file their work neatly, then in order to clean & degrease it well, it is boiled in <span class="m">vinegar</span>. Then they dry it with <span class="m">linen</span>, afterwards they heat it & pass some <span class="m">resin</span> over it, which induces a shining skin like varnish. This done, they melt some pure & fine <span class="m">tin</span> in their <span class="m">tin</span>ning tool, which is a <span class="m">square little iron box.</span> And when the <span class="m">tin</span> is well melted and moderately warm, they throw some <span class="m">resin</span> in to consume the scum, & then they temper the head of a nail or something similar for a bit, and having been left in for seven or eight pauses, they take it out and shake it, hitting it with some <span class="m">iron</span> to make the the superfluous <span class="m">tin</span> fall off, & clean it with a small stick wrapped in <span class="m">tow</span>. And if it is not well <span class="m">tin</span>ned, you will hit it until it it hot with a piece of <span class="m">resin</span> and do as before before and leave it to get cold. When the work cools down it becomes yellow, which is a sign that the <span class="m">tin</span> is the right temperature. But it becomes blue if the <span class="m">tin</span> is too hot. Things so <span class="m">tin</span>ned are of a duration, & do not come undone at all, like the tinning done by leaves. But at the end of a year they can be clarified & renewed by heating & striking them.
 
<span class="pro">Leadsmiths</span> say that making a lizard die in the <span class="m">melted tin</span> makes the <span class="m">tin</span>ning become very golden. Or else by adding <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>.
