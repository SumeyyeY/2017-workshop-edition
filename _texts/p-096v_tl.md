## Grey hilts

 
When they are white, it is necessary only to clean them well, and then to heat them over a fire, and make them turn blue. And take good care that they do not turn too blue, since neither <span class="m">gold</span> nor <span class="m">silver</span> nor any color would set. To accomplish this, which is called les faire passer, have a caldron full of <span class="m">ashes</span> that you cover with some <span class="m">blazing hot charcoal</span>, and heat the <span class="m">ashes</span> thus very well, for an hour or two. And when the <span class="m">ashes</span> are very hot, put the <span class="m">charcoal</span> aside and put the hilt where the <span class="m">charcoal</span> was, and cover it completely with <span class="m">ashes</span>. And when the body, which is the main part of the hilt, is completely colored, flip it onto the other side. In that way, the grey cannot color it too dark, unless some <span class="m">hot coal</span> touches it. Greying can be achieved in an ordinary fireplace, too, but there is a danger that it may sit there too long and make a crust which which will prevent the color from setting. Blue coloring is obtained as soon as the <span class="m">ashes</span> have heated the hilts a little bit, but it will always be grey on some sides. After blue comes grey.
 
 
  

## Color of water

 
For the color of water, pass a <span class="tl">soft file</span> on the hilts to whiten them, then the <span class="tl">burnisher</span>. Afterwards, you color them blue until they become grey. Next, when they are still slightly hot, pass <span class="m">bloodstone</span> over them, and, as they cool, one turns them to reheat them, since the color of water is achieved only after doing this a few times. And if hilts weren't warm, the <span class="m">bloodstone</span> would scrape them and undo the color. Pay attention that hilts don't become too grey, since they would give off soot that would prevent the color from setting. Almost one day is necessary to prepare, soften, and set the color of water, but as soon as they turn a little blue, it is enough for grey or other colors. Grey is the lesser color, after varnish made of two colors, either yellow or black.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Yellow varnish</span>

 
One should vigorously whiten and clean the hilts well. After that, with a feather, one coats them entirely, when they are cold, with <span class="m">nut <span class="del">olive</span> oil</span>. Then, turn them over a good <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire like that of the <span class="pro">furbishers</span>' furnace without letting them touch the <span class="m">charcoal</span> or <span class="m">ashes</span>. And when they stop smoking, it is done.
