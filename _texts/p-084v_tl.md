## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
I tried the <span class="m">hoof of an ox</span>, quite burned & pulverized & very well crushed on <span class="m">porphyry</span>, until it is fine enough to slip through your fingers without being felt. On its own, it makes a very clean mold. But because on its own it is very dry & lean, it demands to be well wet & humidified, with a thick broth with <span class="m">elm root</span>.
 
<span class="m">Dross of Iron</span>, very burned <span class="m">ox hoof</span>, and <span class="m">felt</span>, all burn well in a closed fire. All three ground very finely on <span class="m">porphyry</span> mold very neatly in <span class="m">lead</span>, without any need to reheat it much, & by casting in a box mold either hot or cold.
 
<span class="m">Felt</span> on its own provides a very clean mold if wet, & comes off easily. And also makes the other two come off easily

A fat <span class="m">metal</span> needs lean <span class="m">sand</span>.
 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Eau Magistra</span>

 
Some people think that <span class="m">salt water</span> is not good, because the <span class="m">salt</span> releases gas when heated & as a result causes bubbles. [In this case], there is only <span class="m">wine</span> boiled with <span class="m">elm root</span>.
 
<span class="m">Sanding charcoal</span> makes [things] come off well. But one finds that <span class="m">willow charcoal</span> creates bubbles, but <span class="m">oak</span> or <span class="m">beech charcoal</span> does the job without making bubbles.

## <span class="m">Lead</span>

 
For casting, there is only <span class="m">soft lead</span> that can be cast at a high temperature. And <span class="m">soft tin</span>.
 
 
  

##  <span class="m">Sand</span>, for the most excellent <span class="m">lead</span> of all, for large and small reliefs

 
 I took <span class="m">white lead</span> and crushed it dry on <span class="m">porphyry</span>, to make it very fine. Then I moistened it a lot with very well beaten <span class="m">egg white</span>, so that it became like a paste, by making it stick together perfectly with the flat of a knife. I let it rest for a while.
