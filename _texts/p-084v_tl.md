## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
I tried the <span class="m">bone of oxen <span class="add">feet</span></span>, very burned & pulverized & ground on <span class="m">porphyry</span>, until it is not felt between your fingers. It molds on its own very neatly. But because on its own it is very arid & lean, it wants to be well moistened & dampened with wine boiled with elm root.
 
<span class="m">Iron dross</span>, well burned <span class="m">bone of oxen feet</span>, <span class="m">felt</span> also well burned over a closed fire, and all three very well ground on <span class="m">porphyry</span> mold very neatly in <span class="m">lead</span>, without needing to be reheated a lot, & casting <span class="del">le</span>in a hot or cold frame.
 
<span class="m">Felt</span> alone molds very neatly once moistened & releases well, and also makes the other two release.

A fat <span class="m">metal</span> needs lean <span class="m">sand</span>.
 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Eau Magistra</span>

 
Some people think that <span class="m">salt water</span> is not good, because the <span class="m">salt</span> cracks in fire, & consequently should make it porous. a result causes bubbles. There is only <span class="m">wine</span> boiled with <span class="m">elm root</span>.
 
<span class="m">Charcoal</span> for poncer makes for a good release, but one finds the one of willow make it porous. The one of <span class="m">oak</span> or <span class="m">beech</span> does well without making it porous.

## <span class="m">Lead</span>

 
For casting, there is only <span class="m">soft lead</span> that wants to be cast very <span class="del">g</span> hot, and <span class="m">soft tin</span>.
 
 
  

##  <span class="m">Sand</span> for lead, the most excellent of all, for large and small reliefs

 
 I took <span class="m">ceruse</span> and crushed it dry on <span class="m">porphyry</span>, to make it very fine, then I moistened so much, with well beaten <span class="m">egg glaire</span>, that it was like a paste, smoothing it perfectly with the dull side of a knife. I left it a little.
