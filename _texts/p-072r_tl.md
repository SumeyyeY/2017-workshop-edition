## Printer's letters

 
The people who make the letters mix with the <span class="m">lead</span> <span class="del">nails</span> <span class="m">heads of nails</span> & <span class="m">old horseshoes</span>, & <span class="m">antimony</span> to help melting. This mixture is good for printing, &holds steady. It flows and is well suited to casting in <span class="m">lead</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Copper</span> casting

 
The box mold should be even—shaped & well fitted onto the board where it is placed, so that it will hold steady & even when one moulds. The sand should be clean & carefully selected, well baked, & regarding the sand you will pour directly over the medal and press the harder while molding, it should be very finely pulverised on the <span class="m">marble</span>. Be careful not to oil your medal or the <span class="m">metal</span> will be brittle. Bake slowly and thoroughly, & let cool. Moisten your sand with <span class="m">wine</span> boiled with <span class="m">elm root</span>, and in it, cast <span class="m">well—flowing latten</span> (that is, <span class="m">latten</span> from scales and similar thin things). Cast as widely as possible, & although the stream [of <span class="m">metal</span>] will not be very thick, it will not be any worse. Still, make sure it enters the mold well. Cast from the foot of the medal up, so that the face, further away from the heat, comes out better & the violent effect of the heat is softened. And if your box mold does not have furrows, draw some <span class="del"></span> in the sand, from the borders of the mold towards the hollow where you will be casting. Cast very hot; you will know [if you are at the right temperature] by throwing a bit of your reserved material into what is already <span class="del"></span> very molten, & if it melts right away, it is a sign that [your metal] is hot enough. Then maintain a vigorous heat in your furnace with <span class="m">bellows</span> of an appropriate size, while holding the mouth of your furnace well covered with a large <span class="del"></span> <span class="m">tile</span> or something similar that needs to be red before the casting. When you want to cast, have your mollettes red hot, & the iron hook as well, to clean out the charcoals [fallen] in your material. Having cast, scrub your work with a <span class="m">latten</span> wirebrush. The residual powder from large scissors & large knives is very good for <span class="m">copper</span>.
