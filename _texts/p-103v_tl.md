## Enema

 
 In order for the pipe to not hurt children at all, or those with swollen or protruding hemorrhoidal veins, one covers the pipe with a parcel of <span class="m">chicken entrail</span> and fold it over the end, and in this way, one gives the enema.
 
 
  

## Casting

 
 <span class="m">Tin</span> recoils if thick, therefore it is better to cast it thin and from one piece, to make two and then solder them together, if necessary. One makes use of a strong piece of <span class="m">taffeta</span> to sieve the fine sand with which one first covers the medal, which is of the thickness of a teston.
 
 
  

## To make colors fluid

 
 Mix some <span class="m">vinegar</span> with a bit of <span class="m">bile</span>, put it into a <span class="m">glass</span> bottle, and if you want to preserve it for a long time, add some <span class="m">salt</span> and mix some of this with your colors which will make them flow.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Earwax</span>

 
 If you take enough with the tip of an ear picker and you sieve it with foam of <span class="m">urine</span>, which often forms in <span class="sup">the <span class="m">urine</span></span> of those who have a headache, all the foam will dissipate.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Enamels</span>

 
 To well recognize their difference and their true color by candlelight, it is necessary to put the candle behind a <span class="m">crystal</span> mirror, or a <span class="m">glass</span> globe or jar full of <span class="m">water</span>, because this light is like sunlight.
