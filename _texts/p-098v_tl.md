## Small dogs

 
Small barbet dogs are recognizable thanks to their muzzle which is larger than that of other dogs.
 
 
  

## Salted <span class="m">artichokes</span>

 
One should put them fill and not too ripe in a small barrel full of <span class="m">brine</span>. Then can be served all year long, with salads, <span class="m">oil</span> and <span class="m">vinegar</span>, raw, as prepared in this way they take long to cook. Make sure to try your <span class="m">brine</span> with an <span class="m">egg</span>: if it is good, the <span class="m">egg</span> will float in it. If it does not float, it means <span class="x">the <span class="m">brine</span></span> is not strong enough and would not conserve the <span class="m">fruits</span>.
 
 
  

## Trees

 
Those which carry <span class="m">fruits</span> age early and do not last long.
 
 
  

## Birds

 
Those who have been fed at the spit do not sing among or the company of other birds, they do only when they have their own cage. To teach them to sing well, they have to be taken from their nest as young as possible, and be covered with a <span class="m">duvet</span> or <span class="m">rabbit skin</span>. That way, having not seen their father and known their voice, they learn better to sing the way they are taught to.
 
 
  

## Melting

 
The <span class="m">potée</span> is made of <span class="m">burnt earth</span> which has served for the melting. It is the <span class="m">earth</span> bourré bolvene in which it has been melted. It should be ground against a large <span class="m">stone</span> slab, & of this one should make the first coat of the mantle of the bell, where the letters & ornementations are to be found & It does not require to be cooked again against <span class="m">hay fire</span> and will mold very neatly.
 
The <span class="m">earth</span> used for the molding of the core is likely to swell if you do not strongly rub the molded piece with a brush or the finger and if it is not well <span class="m">oil</span>ed. And you need to do it one coat at a time rather than all at once.
