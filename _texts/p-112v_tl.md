to cast, force feed it <span class="sup">your animal</span> some good <span class="m">spirits</span> or mix a bit of <span class="m">spirits</span> with the <span class="m">vinegar</span>. And soon it will be dead without any wounds that would deform it. As for large animals, for which it is necessary to have a lot of <span class="m">spirits</span>, one uses <span class="m">vinegar</span> and <span class="m">urine</span>, but for small ones, <span class="m">spirits</span> only are needed, and it will be done quicker.
 
When your animal is dead, take it out and clean it very carefully, <span class="sup">relieving it</span> of its old skin if it sheds, of its <span class="al">parasites</span> like <span class="al">lizards</span> have, and then apply it.

## Affixing and arranging animals

 
Having gotten in some fat <span class="m">earth</span> called <span class="m">clay</span>, that should be grey, because that is the best one, or another that will bind well and will be well prepared and beaten, so that it is malleable without being damaging your hands or the work, make a lazagne, or a pancake shape, of this <span class="m">clay</span> equally flattened with a rolling pin, which <span class="pro">pastry—makers</span> use so that it is slightly thicker than a poulc. And on this pancake, affix your animal, making it as life—like as possible and the way in which it is naturally shaped. And firstly, with a good needle, pierce it from underneath, in the middle of the throat, up to the top bone of the head. Then take the needle out and in the hole, put the point of an <span class="m">iron</span> wire, of such a length that it suffices to maintain the head of the animal as high as it must be, and if the skin gets in when you put in the wire, take it out with the edge of your small pincer, and arrange the skin as it was before. Pierce the other end of the wire in the sheet of <span class="m">clay</span>. In this way the head will be held high, which will make it more graceful and proud. Arrange afterwards, the rest of the body, and the legs, and the curling as you think will look best. And so that it is secure and does not move when you put in the sand, secure the legs with little points of <span class="m">iron</span> wire, having already made the first hole with a very sharp needle. Do the same on the body parts that you deem necessary, making sure that the points going through the animal are fixed in the <span class="m">clay</span> sheet, and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal by a

> Take a needle of fine <span class="m">steel</span>, and which will be the sharpest you can find, so that with it, when you make your first hole in order to place the wire threads, it will pass through without effort, and take care not to rudely insert the wire or take skin with it. Then put a thicker wire in the thick bits [of the animal] and the thinner wire in the thinner bits. But take this secret advice and do not plant your pointed wire in one go through the animal and onto the <span class="m">plaster</span>, but having planted it, take it out of the <span class="m">clay</span> earth but not out of the animal, which is afterwards fastened there. One does this because by fastening the point the first time, it pushes in the skin of the serpent and by taking the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.
