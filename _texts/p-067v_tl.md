## <span class="tl">Files</span>

 
If they are not trempées à pacquet, that is, in the manner described, with <span class="m">soot</span>, <span class="m">salt</span>, & <span class="m">vinegar</span>, they will not be good. The large <span class="tl">square files</span> used by <span class="pro">locksmiths</span> to draft their work are only made of <span class="m">fer doulx</span>, But the <span class="tl">soft files</span> should be made of <span class="m">steel</span>. <span class="pro">Founders</span> whose work is to repair <span class="m">latten</span> & <span class="m">copper</span> should have their files coarse otherwise they fill up with <span class="m">copper</span> which makes them smooth & soon renders them useless. <span class="m">Latten</span>, which is more brittle, welcomes softer files than <span class="m">copper</span> does.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="al">Oxen</span> foot bones for sand</span>

 
Once having been burned well twice & pulverized, they mold very neatly in sand & need not be reheated, but simply heated with the flame of <span class="m">straw</span>. But if you mold them in a noyau, give it its first layer, simple & very thin, with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, & leave to dry at ease. Next fortify the following layers with <span class="m">wadding</span> mixed with the said tempered <span class="m">bone sand</span>.

>   It is the neatest sand that can be found for <span class="m">copper</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Essential oils</span>

 
<span class="m"><span class="add">Walnut</span> oil</span> mixed with an equal quantity of <span class="m">turpentine</span> and distilled with an alembic produces an <span class="m">essence</span> whiter than common <span class="m">water</span>. But this has no body & does not unite colors, which are immediately imbibed, and then color is left unable to grip and fades away. Imbibed thus, they would not let you work with or soften them, anymore than in distemper. But you can rectify this flaw by giving it a little body with <span class="m">turpentine</span>, <span class="sup">but</span> not as thickly as you would use for varnishing. And thus you can work with <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span>, & make perfect <span class="m">lead white</span>. <span class="m">Turpentine varnish</span> made from this <span class="m">oil</span> dries within one hour.
