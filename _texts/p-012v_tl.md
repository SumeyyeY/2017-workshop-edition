## Moulding <span class="m">stucco</span> promptly

 
Grind & pulverize finely <span class="m">brick</span> or <span class="m"><span class="pl">Armenian</span> bole</span> or <span class="m">bloodstone</span> & incorporate it with melted <span class="m">wax</span>, & thus melted, throw like others on a <span class="tl">relief medal</span>, & thus you will have a cavity where you will be able to cast with <span class="m">plaster</span>, <span class="m">crushed paper</span> or <span class="m">cimolee</span>.

## Cleaning <span class="m">yellow pearls</span>

 
Gently boil them in a <span class="tl"><span class="pro">goldsmith</span>'s bouteure</span> then, with <span class="m">tripoli</span> & a piece of <span class="m">leather</span>, sprinkled on the flesh side with the <span class="m">powder of the said tripoli</span>, rub & polish the <span class="m">pearl</span>.
 
 
  

## To whiten <span class="m">enilanroc</span>

 
Some believe the <span class="m">ceruse</span>—color crust that is on top to be natural. Others say that it is a lost secret of ancient <span class="pro">lapidaries</span>. Others say that it is <span class="m">enamel</span> that has been reheated. And, from this crust, one can form multiple ciphers, letters, circles and other bizarre motifs. As to the means, I proceeded thus: I once wanted to add a layer of <span class="m">arsenic</span> ground on <span class="m"><span class="tl">marble</span></span>. However, I did the experiment without it, and I put the above mentioned thing, <span class="m">enilanroc</span>, in a small <span class="m">iron</span> <span class="tl">casket</span> on the fire of my <span class="tl"><span class="pro">goldsmith</span>'s forge</span> with three or four small half—burnt <span class="m">coals</span> and blew on it only with my mouth. However, the thing caught fire and became all white, not only on its surface but also inside. And then I let it cool on its own near the fire, since otherwise, exposing it suddenly to cold air, it would have cracked. While it was all white, I passed it through my <span class="tl"><span class="m">lead</span> wheel</span> and I found it to be as hard as it was before. And after scraping off a little of the white, I found it to be of a clear fleshy tone. Finally, I polished it and observed that it took quite a beautiful polish luster and that it could compare with a quite beautiful <span class="m">agate</span> for the purpose of engraving it with some beautiful face and applying it to a table of
