with <span class="m">half lead</span> comes out almost better than <span class="m">tin</span> <span class="del">pure</span> <span class="del"><span class="add">or</span></span> or <span class="m">pure lead</span>, even though in any case they come out well. Nevertheless take care not to cast <span class="m">lead</span> not as hot as <span class="m">tin</span>. In big works it is necessary to moisten the <span class="m">sands</span> with <span class="m">magistra</span> or <span class="m">egg white</span>.

## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way lean & arid, such that it does not bind at all, like the one from the sea or <span class="del">desei</span> from sandy paths dried out by the sun. But choose them <span class="del">or in t</span> preferably from quar<span class="del">reries</span>ries or rock caves, because that one is best, as long as it is very fine. You will know the vein if, in the greyish rocks or quarries <span class="del">qu</span> that seem to be made of arenes, you see after rainy weather, certain little amounts like dust attached to the said rocks, or if a little piece flakes off, easily crushed between your hands, due to humidity. You will also find it in lean soils, which comes off in <span class="del">lop</span> large lumps like stones of tuf <span class="del">et ne</span>, or among terres boulvènes, which are much better than those from fat & strong earths. And one ought not to take it from the surface, for fear that it be mixed with common earth, but three or 4 feet below & the closest to the tuf or stone. Since it comes out in large lumps one would say it starts to form itself in stone. But when it is wet, it comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it is well granular, & that when crushing it between the fingers, it renders itself really very fine, <span class="del">like impalpable</span>, keeping nevertheless its sandy asperity, without muddying the fingers like clay. It dries up slightly on the <span class="m">fire</span>, then it disintegrates & passes finely through a double sieve or a <span class="m">linen</span> sleeve, then takes moistures with <span class="m">wine</span> or <span class="m">magistra</span> & @ / Green

>   The Toulouse <span class="pro">molder</span> reheats it strongly then grinds it finely on <span class="m">marble</span> and passes it through a <span class="m">linen</span> & moistens <span class="del">pass</span> it with <span class="m">wine</span>. He makes the cast very broad & <span class="del">ne</span> flat & barely deep. He casts <span class="m">pure latton</span> used for scales & similar thin things. He casts very hot.
