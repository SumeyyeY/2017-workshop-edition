## A way for molding excellently with water

 
 Dissolve in damp place some <span class="m">tallow of glass</span>, and then place this water on what you want to mold, having encircled it, and place it to coagulate on the hot ashes. Do the same with <span class="m">vitriol</span> & <span class="m">copperas</span>, which, once well calcinated, reduce in water.
 
 
  

##  Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other.

 
 It is necessary to cast two pieces of <span class="m">copper</span>, <span class="m">latten</span> or similar <span class="m">metal</span>, very neatly, and then when you have molded the cavity in the sand, leave the figure of metal that you have molded in the frame, without moving it from its place. And cast, & if there is not enough thickness press a little & push the figure down in the frame.
 
 It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at the entry of the medal, & there, where the force is, the filth & grime accumulate. And, in this way, if you were mold the face towards the cast, some grime could be found there, & it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier to repair.
 
 <span class="m">Vinegar</span> is better for moistening than <span class="m">wine</span>. It is necessary that the frame be well smooth and even, otherwise <span class="del">and that the cast be</span>, as you press on one side, the other one lifts.
 
 This is why the press is better, for it tightens evenly, & more than your hands, and makes the lumpy <span class="m">sand</span>, which is damp, communicate its humidity to the soft and fine sand, which is sprinkled & poncé dry on the medal.
 
 When you mold, always leave your medal <span class="add">the</span> frames, <span class="del">is</span> <span class="add">without stirring it</span> because, if your cavity is not molded very neatly, you can put it back in the right place by means of pegs, which will prevent it from shifting. But, at first, ponce yout medal with very fine willow charcoal, & <span class="del">se</span> next clean it, for this degreases it, & makes it easier to release.
 
Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the frame & the sand.

** Bellows **

 
To cast with a bellows furnace, & cast the hottest you can. Do not place your bellows at the bottom around the base of the furnace, lest some coal should enter them. Place the bellows under the grate. It is wise to place your furnace in a place where there is wind so that the heat will grow better. It is necessary to stop carefully the doors of the furnace, & that way only the bellows have an opening. At the end of the cast, you will blow slowly, as you did at the beginning.
