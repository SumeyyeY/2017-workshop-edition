*[continued]*
  
<span class="m">Lake</span> and <span class="m">white lead</span> and <span class="m">ceruse</span> are easy to work with some <span class="m">oil</span>, but every kind of <span class="m">azure</span> is difficult. And to make a beautiful <span class="m">azure</span>, one has to lay it not with big strokes of the brush but with fine strokes of the end. Not only for <span class="m">azurite ash</span> and <span class="m">azur</span> from <span class="pl">Acre</span> but mainly for <span class="m">enamel azur</span> which has to be very fine, otherwise you will not be able to work with it unless with hard work and you have to mingle it with some <span class="m">turpentine</span> to thicken it and and to mingle it with some <span class="m">white lead</span>. Any <span class="m">azure</span> must not neither be ground nor washed for it loses its color and become pale. But put some of it powdered on your palette and you moisten it bit by bit with some <span class="m">nut oil</span> or <span class="m">turpentine</span>, dip a knife point in some <span class="m">oil</span> and then mix it bit by bit on the said palette

 
  

## Shadows

 
First shadows which are closer to the daylight have to be light and very faint then the last ones very dark to enhance strongly the relief. The <span class="pl">Italians</span> usually make three shadows, the first one very faint, the second one darker and the third one very dark, then put these three shadows together by hatching them from the darkest to the lightest

## <span class="m">Azure</span>

 
<span class="m">Azure</span> is more beautiful when imbibed on the panel <span class="del">without</span> with <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> with which it has been first thinned, without putting in <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span>. And if you want to know if it is dry, breathe on it and it will not shine, thus appearing to be well—imbibed. If not it will shine
 
<span class="m">Azur d'esmail </span> <span class="del">imbibed in <span class="m">oil</span></span> distempered in <span class="m">oil</span>, leaves it & returns to its first nature if you dip it in <span class="m">water</span>.
 
Colors for working in miniature want to be thoroughly ground, & work them with a point of a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> if you want your work to be well—softened.
