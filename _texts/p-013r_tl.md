 <span class="m">agate</span> of various colors. But because this overall whiteness did not correspond with the white crust on the surface that I was seeking, leaving the rest of the thing its natural color, I made a hole in a <span class="m">brick</span>, precisely the same size as the object, and put it inside. Then I heated two <span class="tl"><span class="pro">glassmaker</span>'s soldering irons</span> until they became red hot and, when they were red hot, I applied them one after the other onto the surface of the object until I got the white crust I was looking for, on which I made the drawing that I wanted, revealing the red background, with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">diamond</span> point</span>, and I polished it with <span class="m">hog bristles</span> and <span class="m">tripoli</span>. I don't know if it would be better to reheat it under hot <span class="m">ashes</span>, and if it would be good to encase it in <span class="m">alabaster</span>, which is quite cold, as I did in the <span class="m">brick</span>.
 
 
  

## Carnation with <span class="m">arsenic</span>

 
<span class="m">Sublimated arsenic</span>, t[a]hat is to say, the white kind sold as <span class="m">stone</span>, when ground on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, mixed with <span class="m">vermilion</span> or <span class="m">lake</span> or <span class="m">minium</span>, makes for a beautiful flesh color that is always shiny. <span class="m">Yellow arsenic</span> has a very beautiful color, the white kind works well in <span class="m">oil</span> and compounds well with <span class="m">lake</span>.
 
 
  

## To dye

 
Mix <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> & <span class="m">vitriol</span> & boil them together. Then mix in <span class="m">lake</span> or <span class="m">verdigris</span> & <span class="m">azure</span> or similar, & dye. This will not come off unless the <span class="al">animal</span> sheds. @Non bona.
 
 
  

## Polishing of <span class="m">stones</span>

 
Engraved <span class="m">stones</span> are not polished on a <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> wheel</span>, but with <span class="tl">brushes</span> and <span class="m">tripoli</span>. Yet faceted and flat stones are polished on the said <span class="tl">wheel</span>.
 
 
  

## Fine <span class="tl">sieves</span> of raw <span class="m">silk</span>

 
Tammy of raw <span class="m">silk</span> is made on a weaver, to make very fine and delicate <span class="tl">sieves</span>. And for that effect, you must not choose raw <span class="m">silk</span> whitened by <span class="m">sulfur</span> smoke: this covers the <span class="m">silk</span> in a sticky vapor that would hold the flour and in the end would prevent it from
