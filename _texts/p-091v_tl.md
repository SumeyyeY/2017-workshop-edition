*[continued]*
  
since the two <span class="m">bones</span> are joined, <span class="del">co</span>cut them evenly all around, & make notches <span class="del">e</span> around it in different places which cross over the joining of the two bones , in order to recognize well the place of the first joining. Or else, with little shards of <span class="m">wood</span>, pierce them, or <span class="del">ma</span> coat the joinings with some <span class="m">clay</span>, & dry. Press <span class="del">between them</span> your hands joined between your two knees; & not with a press, because the <span class="m">bones</span> would burst. Mold also at your leisure & two or three times, until you see that it is well pressed tightly together & well imprinted. And each time before replacing the piece, ponce with some <span class="m">willow charcoal</span>, for it makes it release well. When you have cast, rub the medal with oil & with <span class="m">willow charcoal</span> powder & with a brush, to make it dull. Guard against your medal being too greasy or oily, when you mold in <span class="m">cuttlefish bone</span>. When you have cast, leave it to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it brings with it some <span class="m">bone</span>. And, cast moderately hot, something you will know when the bone is about to change its <span class="del">good</span> whiteness. But when it is too hot, it really waxes the <span class="m">bone</span> red. The proportion of <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span> is as much one as the other. If the piece is difficult to come out, & of several pieces, make the cast forked with three or four grooves, <span class="del">and make</span> & direct these grooves to the place of thickest parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like directly on the head, for this attracts the <span class="m">metal</span> & absorbs the figure best. Shake your frame a little when you have cast, and thus you will make very neatly several casts. <span class="m">Tin</span> that is too hot burns the <span class="m">bone</span>, which is corrupted. Also, once taken out <span class="del">du mo</span>hot from the mold, it risks breaking.
