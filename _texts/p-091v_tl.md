*[continued]*
  
Because the two <span class="m">bones</span> are joined, <span class="del"></span>cut around them with precision, and make notches <span class="del"></span> in different places which cross <span class="del"></span> through where the two <span class="m">bones</span> are joined, so as to recognize the place where they were first joined. Or with little shards of <span class="m">wood</span>, you can also pierce the <span class="m">bones</span>, or coat the joints with <span class="m">clay</span>, and leave it to dry. Compress <span class="del">between them</span> it with your two hands in between your knees; and do not use a <span class="sup">normal</span> press, otherwise the <span class="m">bones</span> will break. Mold at your leisure two or three times, until you can see that it has the design come up and is well imprinted. And on each occasion rather than putting the piece straight back in the mold, smooth with <span class="m">willow charcoal</span> because it helps it to come out easily. Once you have cast, rub your medal with <span class="m">oil</span> and <span class="m">willow charcoal</span> with a brush, to make it dull. Take care that your medal is not greasy or oily when you cast it in <span class="m">cuttlefish bone</span>. Once you have cast, leave it to cool rather than taking the medal out straight away, because when one takes it out hot, some <span class="m">bone</span> will come away with the medal. Cast at medium heat, which you will recognize because the bone should stay almost <span class="del"></span> white. But when it is too hot, the <span class="m">bone</span> becomes brown. The proportion of <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span> is equal, one to the other. If the piece is difficult to cast, and composed of various pieces, cast it with a forked pattern, of three or four grooves, <span class="del">and make</span> and make these grooves where the <span class="m">metal</span> is the thickest. Also make these grooves around the medal and directly on the head because this attracts the <span class="m">metal</span> and will fill the figure best. Lift your boxmold a little, once you cast, and in this way you will be able to make several clean casts. <span class="m">Tin</span> that is too hot burns the <span class="m">bone</span> which becomes damaged. Moreover, having come out of the mold hot <span class="del"></span>, it risks breaking.
