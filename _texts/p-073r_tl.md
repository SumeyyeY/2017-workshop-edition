## For making <span class="m">blue varnish</span>

 
Take the <span class="m">blue of flowers <span class="add">florey or of <span class="pl">Flanders</span></span></span> & <span class="m">quicklime</span>, and put in around four <span class="ms"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> of <span class="m">water</span>, and let it soak one <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">day</span></span>. Take the <span class="m">water</span> where the said <span class="m">quicklime</span> has soaked, and put your <span class="m">blue</span> with it, and lay it down on the <span class="m">wood</span>.
 
 
  

## For orange color

 
Take the <span class="m">water</span> where the <span class="m">quicklime</span> will have soaked and some <span class="m">turmeric</span>, and put them one with the other, and then you will put them on your <span class="m">wood</span>.
 
 
  

## For ridding <span class="m">bone</span> or <span class="m">horn</span> of fattiness

 
One needs to make them boil in <span class="m">quicklime</span>, and it must always have <span class="m">water</span>, and take a very clean pan. And when they are washed, make them boil in the <span class="m">ashes of vine shoots</span>, and put them inside the hottest pot you can, and put <span class="m">verdigris</span> into the <span class="pro">goldsmith's</span> <span class="m">water</span> pot, and leave for the space of some time, and you will see a very beautiful green color.
 
 
  

## For making gray <span class="m">wood</span>

 
Take <span class="m">alum</span> with <span class="m">river water</span>, make them boil together, then take <span class="m">river water</span> with <span class="m">bran</span>, submerge the <span class="m">bran</span> and crush it together. Take <span class="m">iron filings</span> & <span class="m">sulfur</span> & <span class="m">verdigris</span> and <span class="m">fuller's earth</span> , and make it all boil together, and crush <span class="m">maplewood</span> which will have been soaked in <span class="m">water</span> of <span class="m">alum</span> and <span class="m">well water</span>, & put it to boil together. <span class="add">All of this will be done better in hollow sandstone.</span>
 
 
  

## For making bronze in <span class="m">gold</span> color

 
Take one ounce of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> and crush them in an <span class="m">iron</span> mortar. Once well crushed, take one ounce of <span class="m">sulfur</span>, and
