*[continued]*
  
<span class="m">Earth</span>, or sand, moistened or ground with water, wants to be reheated more than <span class="m">sand</span>.
 
<span class="m">Latten from a candlestick</span> is not pure, for one mixes in it <span class="m">iron filings</span> & <span class="m">potin</span>.
 
<span class="m">Latten</span> wants to be cast hotter than <span class="m">copper</span>, quod non credo.
 
One ought not, to cast carefully, to take metals already alloyed, but take them pure & mix them.
 
<span class="m">Iron</span> hardly agrees with being cast in a mixture of <span class="m">copper</span> or <span class="m">latten</span>.
 
It is better all with a <span class="m">sand</span>, either in a frame or noyau at once, either as a molding box or <span class="m">noyau</span>, rather than several mixed.

>   One ought to reheat for one or two hours <span class="del">etp</span>, in <span class="add"><span class="del">that</span>a</span> charcoal fire which lights by itself, a crucible with the substance inside, and then blow & cover the crucible with large charcoals & the mouth of the furnace with bricks, and let it consume two or three feedings of charcoal, which fill the furnace above the crucible. In the end feed and stoke the fire, & when the flame is very white & that the substance will be in liquid bath like <span class="m">water</span> & casting off pale blue flames, cast. The secret is to cast <span class="add">very</span> hot & in one go.
 
 
  

## Lean white <span class="m">sand</span>

 
 without bond renders well proper for casting, & having body, if you grind it very finely on <span class="m">porphyry</span> or calcine it, reddening it several times in the fire, & being in vinegar, or finely ground with water as you know, it also molds very neatly in noyau, as I have experimented. But do not moisten it with salt water if you want to quickly reheat it, for salt boils on the fire & makes bubbles, being pressed by the fire. I believe that the noyau, gently reheated, would not do this. I molded very neatly in noyau the substance of skillets. White <span class="m">sand</span> smells like <span class="m">sulphur</span> when reheated, and I believe it would melt. And since the substance has been cast in it, it acquires in the mold <span class="del">co<span class="exp">mm</span>e</span> a luster as if it were leaded or vitrified. I believe that <span class="pro">glassmakers</span> could use it.

##  Bell handles

 
 They can be put back on, without remaking the bell, which one ought to put back in the pit, & and mold it there. But should you solder a cracked bell, it is considered impossible to give it its first voice.
