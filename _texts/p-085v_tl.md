## <span class="pro">Casters</span>

 
They mix beaten <span class="m">egg white</span> with <span class="m">earth</span> of which they make the first layer of the crown <span class="sup">of a bell</span> in pieces. <span class="sup">They also make</span> bells & all other said pieces which the said <span class="m"><span class="sup">egg</span> white</span>. This makes <span class="sup">it</span> come clean & sets & stabilizes the material. For the core of a small piece, <span class="m">egg white</span> is also good.
 
<span class="m">Rosette</span> in order to make it come clean, wants the mold to be a little hot & <span class="m">lead</span> which is mixed with the <span class="m">red copper</span> <span class="sup">is</span> therefore chiefly for small pieces.
 
 
  

## Mortars

 
They should be of the finest material possible. <span class="sup">In the same way</span>, it is better to use <span class="m">copper</span> for a cauldron than <span class="m">red copper</span>, because it better resists a blow.
 
The mortars, therefore, used for grinding are stronger & there is less danger of breaking them if they are of fine <span class="m">copper</span>. And for a private home, they do not ring so much & do not make as much noise as those of <span class="m">metal</span>. It is true that those that are of <span class="m">metal</span> ring louder for <span class="pro">apothecaries</span>.
 
Grenades must be made from fine <span class="m">metal</span>
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span> from a mine

 
It wants to be well recooked for big <span class="m">metal</span> <span class="sup">objects</span>. Some people burn it inside a furnace until it becomes quite black and they grind it on the <span class="m">porphyry</span>. Other people burn it with <span class="m">asphalt</span>, but when it is too burned, it does not mold so cleanly, because it lacks body, and is too thin. You can give body to the <span class="m">sand</span> with <span class="m">tripoli</span> or burned <span class="m">felt</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span> Experiments

 
X I have tested <span class="m">sand</span> of <span class="pl">Thoulouse</span>, & after seeing it well recooked two times in a skillet, I passed it through a fine <span class="m">tammy cloth</span>, like the double <span class="sup">sieve</span> which <span class="pro">apothecaries</span> use, without grinding it further on the <span class="m">porphyry</span>, as I have done other times. I moistened it <span class="sup">the sand</span> in infusion with <span class="m">elm root,</span> and in it, I molded a big piece of a portrait of Jesus. I found it unmolded very well without having to tire myself out by hitting it from behind & it molded cleanly on one side of the relief & on the other concave. & it was of the thickness of a coin of forty sols. I cast <span class="sup">this</span> very hot

>  <span class="m">Sand</span> from a mine, well chosen & well reheated, is the most excellent of all without trying to find all other mixtures because it receives all <span class="m">metal.</span> It does not like to be used hot because it bubbles the more finely. For large works, it is not the best because it does not have enough body to sustain <span class="sup">it</span>,
