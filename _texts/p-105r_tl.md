## <span class="al">Turtles</span>

 
Males have shells that turn down at the end near their tails, and their underbelly shells have lined marks along the bottom from their tails to their head. And the females have neither the turned down shell near the tail nor the marks.
 
 
  

## Drying colors

 
<span class="m">Soot black</span> and others will not dry in oil unless you add <span class="m">verdigris</span>.
 
 
  

## Painting

 
Colors that have been applied twice are more gritty by themselves, unless they have a binding agent. Otherwise, paint on <span class="m">wood</span>; otherwise, on <span class="m">canvas</span>; otherwise on walls.
 
 
  

## Gardening

 
To graft, it is necessary to take the new growth that was produced within the year by the tree you wish to graft. And cut off a branch in which you can see that beside the place where the leaves join the stem, there are little buttons we call buds, the initial stages of a sprout. With dexterity you must, with a very sharp pen—knife, cut in the shape of a graft a small bit of the skin <span class="sup">of the tree</span>, which contains a bud or a sprout with the leaf, as you can see in B. Then on the tender wood, which is full of sap, and on which you wish to graft, cut quickly two lines as you can see , then add in the middle a slit thusly

 . Then with the point of your pen—knife separate the bark <span class="sup">from the tree</span>, and open it from the slit in the middle, and having neatly lodged your graft so that nothing is sticking out, only the sprout, binding everything well and wrap the whole thing with a bit of <span class="m">linen</span> or soft string. In this way, there will be nothing uncovered but the leaf, which in three or 4 days will indicate whether the graft has taken hold, by being green. Keep your graft in this way for seven or eight days. Then unwrap it, and join it to the bark, keeping the sprout itself straight, and then rewrap the whole thing gently, but not as strongly as before. And if there is any growth, leave it some room to grow and then three or four times
