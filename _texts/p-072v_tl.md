## Casting

 
<span class="m">Lead</span>, which is soft & heavy, wants to be cast much hotter than <span class="m">tin</span>. When it is not hot enough, it makes lines in the medal<span class="del"></span>. <span class="m">Straw</span> burns in it, if it is hot <span class="sup">enough</span>. It makes a solder so soft & runny that it can be melted in a <span class="m">tin</span> dish. It is composed of one part out of <span class="m">looking glass tin</span>, of one part out of <span class="m">soft tin</span>, & another part of <span class="m">lead</span>. It <span class="sup">the solder</span> runs very cleanly and casts in sheets, but the work is very rough & breaks. The best solder, for casting well, is the common one, <span class="del"></span>but it leaves certain coarse crumbs. Combine <span class="m">lead</span> with <span class="m">tin</span> so that the ingot that you are going to cast becomes smooth & lustrous & polished, & doesn't make any eyes or bubbles except for a small point in the middle. And this sign will tell you that there is enough <span class="m">tin</span>, otherwise the <span class="m">lead</span> dominates too much. The sand is good for <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span>. Good <span class="sup">sand</span> is well dried & fine & thin, which however can be picked up between the fingers. The sand wants to be recooked rather than put to work <span class="sup">directly</span>. And <span class="del"></span> to mold with it, it wants to be well dampened & then recooked, not all at once nor under a lot of pressure, because this spoils it, & makes it shrink & also makes it crumble. But if you reheat it, and take your time, it will make it very firm, to be good for molding. It is necessary to filter it through a shirt sleeve in order to make it the more fine, with the aim of putting it first on the piece to be cast.
 
One makes a solder with <span class="m">quicksilver</span><span class="del"></span>that is white, but it is thick. Make sure your box is joined well & that one does not see any daylight between the joints.
 
The Germans cast <span class="m">lead</span> very thinly, because they think it is better than very thick, but as it is too pliable, it is so thin they mix a little <span class="m">tin</span> with the aforementioned lead which, otherwise, would fold like <span class="m">wax</span>.
 
Some say the blackest <span class="m">lead</span> is the best & the softest & flows the best. You recognize the goodness of it by rubbing it with your finger, which will blacken immediately.
 
The good alloy for the flow of <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span> is [made] from one lb of <span class="m">lead</span>, & one and a half lb of <span class="m">tin</span>. It is solder which flows well & that is good for casting, but it is rough.

>   Rub a <span class="m">cuttlefish bone</span> on a table in order to make it flat & one against the other & against the two <span class="m">bones</span> with pegs to keep them in place.

>   <span class="m">Cuttlefish bone</span> molds <span class="m">lead</span> better than [any]thing there is, but try to see if it needs to be recooked. <span class="del">One must mold the back of the <span class="m">bones</span> & along the side of them because the <span class="m">marrow</span> there is more delicate</span>.
 
> *at left middle margin*

>   The <span class="m">marrow</span> near the mouth is more delicate & does have not as many fibers & molds more cleanly. The <span class="m">shell</span> which has the <span class="m">marrow</span> <span class="sup">which</span> is calcinated is good for making sand.

> 
>   When you cast <span class="m">lead</span>, you must cast it <span class="del"></span> somewhat hot, & not at once & shake your frame & cast two or three times. However, if it is too hot, cast it, it will cast swollen & with bubbles. When it is very hot, it becomes blue; leave it then until the color passes <span class="del"></span> & let it rest a little before casting.

>   Some, such as <span class="pro">printers</span>, mix <span class="m">iron filings</span> or <span class="m">pins <span class="sup">filings</span></span> with <span class="m">lead</span> <span class="del"></span> in order to render it hard. But this makes it rough & it breaks <span class="del">not</span> under a hammer.
