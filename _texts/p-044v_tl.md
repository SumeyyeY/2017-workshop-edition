## <span class="m"><span class="al">Horse</span>hair sieves</span>

 
They are made often in <span class="pl">Normandy</span> with <span class="m"><span class="al">horse</span>tail hairy</span> that they clean with some washing <span class="m">water</span> because they pick them out with their mouth and separate short and broken ones. They do not make the <span class="m">thread</span> longer than the sieve and it is round. They attach the black or white <span class="m">hair</span> at the two edges of the thread, according to the piece they want to make. And the thread is woven above and below like any other fabric. And passing a small flat stick of ii or three fingers wide between two, they pass between after two bits of hair at each step strike and weave with three steps. The entire sieve is made of xvii bits of <span class="m">hair</span>. They sell them by dozens and each xxx sols. They bring them to <span class="pl">Toulouse</span> to send them then to <span class="pl">Spain</span> and there, they exchange it with <span class="m">silk</span>.

 
  

## Excellent <span class="m">water</span> against the pest by the Master of Montorsin

 
Take some <span class="m">theriac rue</span>, dittany and good <span class="m">vinegar</span>, put the whole in a <span class="m">glass</span> bottle and leave it halfâ€”open and well attached. And put it in a bath for three or 4 days. Then take some of your brew from its container when you need it and pour some, when necessary, on a red hot tile and receive the vapor and also perfume your clothes. This is a very precious and proved secret.

 
  

## <span class="m">White soporific oil</span>

 
Have x or 12 <span class="m">Mandragore apples</span>, put them in quarters together with some <span class="m">olive oil</span> in a glass bottle which you will cook in a bain marie for two days and your <span class="m">oil</span> will turn white with which you rub the sole of your feet and you will quickly feel sleepy.

 
  

## Stucco

 
To stick stones, some do not use gem and pitch <span class="m">black rosin</span> because it is too greasy, but they use as much <span class="m">rosin</span> and <span class="m">sulphur</span> and the same quantity of <span class="m">wax</span> and then add finely ground <span class="m">brick</span>. Others some white <span class="m">chalk</span> and crushed and powdered and sieved white <span class="m">stone</span>.
