melt the drugs in a new earthenware pot, and when they are melted, you shall pass them through a clean cloth and you will see a beautiful varnish.
 
 
  

## Another varnish

 
Take one ounce of <span class="m">spike lavender oil</span> and heat it over coals; take a half ounce of <span class="m">sandarac</span><span class="del"></span> and grind it coarsely<span class="del"></span>, and then put it in the <span class="m">spike lavender oil</span> and mix it with a stick until it has melted, and then put it in a glass vial, and when you want to use it needs to be heated little by little over the coals, and before applying, lay a coat of very clear <span class="m">glue</span>, and then apply it with a paintbrush.
 
 
  

## To make red varnish

 
Take <span class="m">vermillion</span> and dilute it with <span class="m">gum water</span> as well as with other <span class="m">water</span> and make it like said varnish, and mix this other <span class="m">water</span> the same way as other varnish and then apply it as above <span class="del">to make green wood</span>.
 
 
  

## To make green <span class="m">wood</span>

 
Take very strong <span class="m">vinegar</span>, <span class="m">salt</span>, and <span class="m">rainwater</span>, and mix it together with <span class="m">verdigris</span>, and put it with your <span class="m">wood</span> in a new earthenware vessel, and lay it in some very warm <span class="m">horse dung</span> for eight or nine days.
