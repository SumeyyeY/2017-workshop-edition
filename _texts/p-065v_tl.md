## Mid—bright colors

 
When colors are absorbed into the <span class="m">canvas</span>, it means that it has been primed only once, and for this reason the colors become matte rather than shiny. But that is best, as long as you retouch it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having more body, will not fade and are much more beautiful, especially <span class="m">azure</span> and <span class="m">lake</span> and those that lack body. But those who want to dispatch their painting carelessly prime twice. Thus the colors will not be absorbed, therefore they will not last as long. The second layer of these colors will not be absorbed and will remain shiny.

** Lifelike **

 
There are some who paint lifelike images on <span class="m">oiled paper</span>, and if they do not complete their work in one go, they put their <span class="m">paper</span> and unfinished painting in <span class="m">water</span> so that it will not dry. 
 
 
  

## Painting large figures

 
You must attach your <span class="m">charcoal</span> to the end of a stick in order to make your first drawing from a distance because up close, you would not be able to judge proportions as well as from a certain and sufficient distance. Also, when you paint up close, hold your <span class="m">charcoal</span> as far as you can, practically with your fingertips. For in that way you will acquire an artist's touch and make your hand light.

>   When painting on <span class="m">paper</span>, <span class="pro">illuminators</span> distemper their colors with <span class="m">gum</span> and mix in a little <span class="m">soap</span> to make them run better.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Glazing</span>

 
One usually glazes with colors lacking body, such as <span class="m">lake</span> and <span class="m">verdigris</span>. However, in order to use other sorts, one mixes in plenty of calcined and ground <span class="m">crystal</span>, which also has no body and reduces their thickness.

>   <span class="pro">Painters</span> should all learn how to paint from life, because it is their provision and annuity and means to earn their passage when travelling the land with only their <span class="m">"cocon"</span>. 
 
 
  

## White and black

 
It is useful that an <span class="pro">apprentice</span> should work with black and white for two or three years in order to become an <span class="pro">artist</span>.

** Priming **

 
You must be quite careful about this, and do not do it, as some will, using <span class="m">gold</span> color made by cleaning the <span class="m">oil</span> brushes, because <span class="m">verdigris</span> and other corrosive colors included will end by fading the colors that are laid in after. It is useful to do it with <span class="m">ceruse</span>, <span class="m">yellow ocher</span>, and a bit of <span class="m">massicot</span>, and make it scarcely thick so that it will not crack.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Lead white</span>

 
It does not fade and has a lot of body.
