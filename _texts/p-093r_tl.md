## Olives

 
The olives go bad if you do not refresh their <span class="m">salt water</span> once a month, do not touch it with your hands, otherwise they will go bad.
 
 
  

## Country folk's observation

 
When it freezes on Palm Sunday, it will freeze every month of the year
 
When the first flowers fall because of the frost, the other flowers also start perish.
 
 
  

## Grafts

 
Do not use a graft from <span class="m">old wood</span>, because it never makes a beautiful tree.
 
Leave only two shoots on the graft and no more, otherwise it will become weaker. The wind torments it and leaves it strengthless to propagate by cuttings.
 
Trees which have big pith, such as peach trees, and all other trees of their kind, and the plum trees, can't be grafted when freezing because the cold damages their pith, which also has to be protected avoiding to cut the bottom of the graft.
 
All grafts must not be done earlier than the sap flows up, otherwise they dry.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
The <span class="m">white ash</span> of all kinds of <span class="m">wood</span>, which still sticks to the <span class="m">wood</span> while burning, and which has not fallen into the hearth, molds very clean
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
Very fine pulverized <span class="m">soot</span> molds and removes easily from the mold. The best <span class="m">soot</span>, which is greasy and shiny, is the one from the big kitchens
 
Very fine pulverized <span class="m">quicklime</span> works, but mixed <span class="m">flint,</span> crumbled into the hollow, does better.
