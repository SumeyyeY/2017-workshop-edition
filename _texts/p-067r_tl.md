*[continued]*
  
 daylight, pull out the <span class="m">hairs</span> which make the tip too long with the ends of your fingernails, until the tip appears good to you, & so that you notice in it the <span class="m"><span class="al">rat</span> hairs</span> that are entirely black and the <span class="m">hairs of the same <span class="al">squirrel</span></span> that are <span class="del">at the</span> whitish from the root to the middle. When it pleases you, bind and tighten it very well with a thread in two places, then cut what is superfluous & fit it in a quill of appropriate size, of a <span class="al">duck</span> or a <span class="al">crow</span> for the small ones. Good brushes are those that, once dipped into <span class="m">water</span>, do not bulge when you trace on your hand.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Oil</span>

 
All <span class="m">oil</span> which is imbibed by <span class="m">paper</span> & once heated by fire evaporates & leaves the <span class="m">paper</span> clean, like <span class="m">turpentine</span> & <span class="m">spike lavender oil</span>, is good for making varnish.
 
 
  

## Sand

 
Everything ground & tempered becomes porous, according to some.
 
 
  

## <span class="tl">Bellows furnace</span>

 
Before you put in the <span class="m">metal</span>, it is necessary that it be red at the bottom, like like a <span class="m">charcoal</span> & well inflamed. Next, you <span class="del">[illegible]</span> fill it & cover the <span class="m">charcoal</span> & adjust the <span class="tl">bellows</span>, otherwise the <span class="m">metal</span> on top would melt as a result of the <span class="tl">bellows</span> & its bottom would be curdled & cooled & would not run. But if you proceed in this manner you will melt everything you like.
 
 
  

## Varnish on <span class="m">paper</span>

 
The <span class="pl">Germans</span> make boxes <span class="del">p</span> covered with painted <span class="m">paper</span> & varnish it with <span class="m">egg white</span>, mixed with <span class="m">gum</span> and some <span class="m">oil</span>, not <span class="m">aspic</span>, but another odorant which looks like <span class="m">olive oil</span>. Every work done with <span class="m">egg white</span> sustains <span class="m">oil</span>. It is with this that <span class="pro">painters</span> trick the poor peasants, painting their bands of <span class="m">taffeta</span> with this <span class="m">egg white</span> to be done faster. But the first rain washes away everything.
