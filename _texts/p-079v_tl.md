and put in an <span class="m">earthenware</span>pot, and <span class="sup">make it</span> that very hot <span class="m">ashes</span> are underneath. Little by little, make the fire underneath grow bigger and bigger, and the pot must not be moved. And when it is cooked, and if it takes up to six hours, mind that the smoke does not make you ill because it is bad.

 
  

## Making <span class="m">varnish</span>

 
Take some <span class="m">mastic</span>, <span class="del"></span> @<span class="m">sandarac</span>, <span class="m">gum arabic</span>, and <span class="m">aspic oil</span>, as much of one as the other, and melt them all together. Before coating it, lay a coat of quite clear <span class="m">glue</span> and let it dry.

 
  

## Antidote against the smoke of <span class="m">metals</span>

 
In the morning, take a piece of thin <span class="m">toast</span> with <span class="m">butter</span>, neither <span class="m">antimony</span> nor any other vapors will harm you. Or put half a <span class="m"><span class="al">pig</span>'s bladder</span> in front of your face.

 
  

## <span class="m">Tin</span> for casting

 
They use <span class="m">common tin</span>, which is the one that <span class="pro">pewterers</span> use for plates, which is composed of 9 or <span class="del"></span>ten pounds of pure <span class="m">lead</span> on one quintall of <span class="m">tin</span>.

## Mixture for <span class="pro">printers</span>

 
Apply a coat of <span class="m">antimony</span>, and pulverize on a coat of <span class="m">latten</span>, old <span class="m">metal scrapings</span>, or thin plates of <span class="m">iron</span> or the <span class="del"></span> <span class="m">iron</span> nail heads, and continue in this way until the crucible is full. Melt it inside a four à vent. And then mix in a little <span class="m">tin</span> and fill the rest of the container with <span class="m">lead</span><span class="del"></span>. Build up the fire and stir continuously to make sure that the substances are well—allied. The mixture for large letters is harder.
