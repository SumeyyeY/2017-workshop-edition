## <span class="m">Water</span> to make light for <span class="pro">painters</span>

 
Distill some <span class="m">vine water</span> and put it into a big bottle. Put your <span class="m">candle</span> behind that, and it won't disturb your vision.
 
 
  

## <span class="pl">German</span> chassis

 
<span class="pl">Germans</span> who work in miniature make chassis not of <span class="m">glass</span>, but of <span class="m">canvas</span> oiled with <span class="m">clear turpentine varnish</span>, namely <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">turpentine oil</span> & <span class="ms">almost half</span> <span class="m">turpentine</span>, because this light, which is not as bright as <span class="m">glass</span>, makes them see larger features. And when they want to make something subtle like veins <span class="del">de</span> & similar things, they use <span class="tl">pinceaulx composed of two or three <span class="m"><span class="al">rat</span>whiskers</span></span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Azure enamel</span> with <span class="m">oil</span>

 
One must choose the finest possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work in <span class="m">oil</span>. And if you cannot find any that is fine enough, you may as well grind it, not with <span class="m">water</span> but with <span class="m">oil</span>, and grind it thick. Then lay it on your palette and mix in some <span class="m">turpentine</span> but not much, to make it bind, and make it as thick as <span class="m">butter</span> or <span class="m">mortar</span>, and then, with a large enough brush, work it while always moving the brush freely. Then, to soften it, make jagged hatching <span class="sup">movements</span> with the tip of the brush. The highlights will be made using the same diluted with <span class="m">ceruse</span>, which makes it bind, making it easier to work. I have seen it used thus. It must be very thick, so that you almost need an effort to spread it with your brush. And it will be all the better if you lay down your painting. All these difficulties do not occur when it is very fine and fluid without being crushed, and it doesn't run.

>   <span class="m">Azure</span> needs to be applied neatly, which is why it always fades when it is applied over old, already tarnished, <span class="m">azure</span> to mend an old painting. In such cases, it is better to scrape off the old layer and prime again and then apply the <span class="m">azure</span>. It is the same for almost all other colors. Also azure mixed with <span class="m">oil</span> always remains shiny, which is not good for <span class="m">azure</span> because that makes it fade.
 
 
  

## Grinding colors

 
A slab of <span class="m">glass</span> one inch thick is more appropriate than anything else for grinding colours neatly, especially for <span class="m">lacquer</span> and for <span class="m">whites</span>.
