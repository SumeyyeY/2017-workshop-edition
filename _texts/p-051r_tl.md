## Copying off patterns

 
Make some <span class="m">soap water</span> and with it, rub and moisten the <span class="m">engraved stone</span> that you want to transfer the pattern from, then lay a white sheet of <span class="m">paper</span> on it and rub strongly against it with a sharp piece or the bottom of a <span class="m">glass</span> bottle and you will transfer your stamped piece. It is true that it will be on the left side, but if you apply <span class="m">aspic</span> or <span class="m">turpentine oil</span> on your <span class="m">paper</span>, it will be stamped on the right on the other side. Then trace these lines with a paint brush or a quill, then heat the <span class="m">paper</span> and the <span class="m">oil</span> will evaporate and it will leave your <span class="m">paper</span> white. And if you don't want that to be known if, by chance, you borrowed the <span class="m">cut stone</span>, soak the <span class="m">paper</span> and the polishing that the <span class="pro">polisher</span> made on the back side, which distinguishes what has been made, will not be recognizable. The <span class="m">soap water</span> will turn the piece yellow, but well <span class="m">gummed wate</span>r, which has the same effect, does not do this. If you want to, for the same effect, make <span class="m">gummed wate</span>r then, dissolve some <span class="m">soap</span> in it and do as is said.
 
 
  

## Cutters of printing plates

 
To clean the <span class="m">copper</span> plates or to have used ones print better, boil them for four or five hours in a good <span class="m">detergent</span> with quite used <span class="m">laundry water</span>. Then make your <span class="m">ink</span> with some <span class="m">linseed oil</span> instead of <span class="m">walnut oil</span> and press with the rollers. The <span class="m">copper</span> plates are ready sooner than the <span class="m">wood</span> ones, but they are not so clean to print promptly. The <span class="m">wood</span> ones are tedious but would have sooner printed twenty sheets against two [sheets] of the other. To print with <span class="m">wood</span>, the secret is firstly to poach, that is to say to lay the transferred pattern or drawn piece down on the <span class="m">wood</span> plank and to make sure that the drawn side is stuck to the <span class="m">wood</span>. Once dry, you will gently rub with a moist <span class="m">handkerchief</span> the reverse side of the <span class="m">paper</span> which, by being rubbed, will become so fine that what will remain will almost only be the drawn part, which, after, one should trace while cutting the pattern. You could do that to ornamented <span class="m">glass</span> and <span class="m">glass</span> layered with <span class="m">black</span> cut pieces, to then scrape and layer your <span class="m">colors</span> on the uncovered [side]. To make <span class="m">ink</span> for <span class="m">copper</span> plates
