>   * To make <span class="m">or mat</span> beautiful, put in a little <span class="m">varnish</span> or <span class="m">fatty oil</span>, not from that which is made from the cleaning of <span class="tl">pinceaulx</span>, but the pure, which is made fatty <span class="env">in the sun</span> or mixed with <span class="m">ceruse</span>.
 
<span class="m">Or mat</span> of this sort is scarcely less beautiful than <span class="del">es</span> <span class="add"><span class="m">burnished gold</span></span>, and lasts longer <span class="env">in the rain</span>, & besides, & is made sooner. <span class="m">Burnished gold</span> is cracked <span class="tmp">with time</span> & comes apart <span class="env">in the rain</span>.
 
 
  

## Preventing the swelling of breasts <span class="del">d</span> <span class="add">or to make those that became too large smaller</span>

 
Take large <span class="m">loafs of bread</span> freshly drawn from the oven and cut them in half &, as hot as possible, lay them on <span class="del">& ilz</span> & do this 3 times a day & continue 4 or 5 days. Next, make a plaster with <span class="m"><span class="pl">Venice</span> turpentine</span> or, even better, <span class="m">common turpentine</span>. Mix in <span class="m">sumac</span>, <span class="m">sloe</span> from bushes, <span class="m">quince seeds</span>, <span class="pa">pomegranate flowers</span>, <span class="m">leaves of olive trees</span>, & the like, cooked & mixed with the <span class="m">turpentine</span>. But, I forgot, one needs, after having laid on the hot <span class="m">bread</span>, which is soggy & makes one sweat, to lay on linens soaked with <span class="m">water from a beehive</span>, which is to say <span class="m">honey</span> and <span class="m">wax</span> extracted all together from the beehive.
 
 
  

## Attracting <span class="al">pigeons</span>

 
Fry in a pan with <span class="m">oil</span> some <span class="m">hempseed</span> & give some to the <span class="al">pigeons</span>.
 
 
  

## Against the bruises of eyes

 
At night, apply very thin sheets <span class="m">lead</span>. Singular remedy.
 
 
  

## Pinceaulx

 
In order to make them well, cut the <span class="m">hair from the tail of a <span class="al">squirrel</span></span>, as much as can be held in one go in a card rolled like a hollow straw. And placing them thus in the aforesaid folded card, tap & shuffle it so that the <span class="m">hair</span> gathers together & becomes of the same length. Put one or two <span class="m">hairs of a <span class="al">rat</span>’s whiskers</span> in the middle, then grab & squeeze it tightly with the thumb and index finger. Dip the tip of all this <span class="m">hair</span> well in <span class="m">water</span>, then, moving yourself close to
