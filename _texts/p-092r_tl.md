## <span class="del">Sand</span>Mixture easy to melt

 
One <span class="del">℥ of</span> part <span class="m">soft tin</span>, one part fine <span class="m">lead</span>, one part <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> & one part <span class="m">argent vif arresté</span> makes an alloy & a solder, so easy to melt that it could easily be melted in a dish of fine <span class="m">tin</span>.
 
 
  

## Molding hollow on one side and in relief on the other

 
And for this effect, one casts a medal of fine <span class="m">tin</span>, which is harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves it in one half of the box mold, & presses it a little so that it holds better. And next, you shall cast in your box mold the solder described above, or another more meltable than fine <span class="m">tin</span>. And thus, the second medal will melt & mold itself on the first one without ruining it. But to be safer, temper <span class="m">lamp black</span> with <span class="m">water</span>, & with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, give a light coat of this to the medal, which remains in the box mold, & leave to dry. Thus it will not melt.
 
But if you have a medal of <span class="m">copper</span> or <span class="m">silver</span>, you can leave it in the casting, if you want to cast with <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span>; but it is necessary that it be a little hot, for the cold would make the <span class="m">tin</span> contract.
 
<span class="m">Tin</span> needs to be cast quite hot to come out neat.
 
<span class="m">Tin doulx</span>, which is the best for the cast, is the one that once cast en grille, is <span class="del">burnished &</span> shiny & polished like a mirror, & appears to have been burnished, does not have holes like the one that is brittle, & that is not shiny, as if burnished.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Potin</span>

 
<span class="m">Potin</span>, once cast very hot, runs & drips like <span class="m">tin</span>. But the medal becomes whitish and immediately casts off the green, which good substances do not do.
 
 
  

## Molding statues

 
Half <span class="m">founder’s earth</span>, which <span class="pro">founders</span> use, & half <span class="m">clay earth</span> renders very neatly.
