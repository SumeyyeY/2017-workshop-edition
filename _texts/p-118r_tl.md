## <span class="al">Snails</span>

 
Those which are found in the <span class="env">ocean</span> and similarly those in which certain small crabs dwell are very beautiful for grottoes, if they have been rid of the first layer of their shell with <span class="m">aqua fortis</span>, because they really look to be made of <span class="m">mother—of—pearl</span>.
 
 
  

## For removing flaws and flashing from things <span class="tl">molded</span> in a <span class="tl">core mold</span>

 
If your <span class="tl">molds</span> are made of good <span class="m">plaster</span> which withstands fire, they will not crack, especially if they are squeezed well between two tables with <span class="tl">presses</span> or in a <span class="tl">pot</span> filled with <span class="m">ashes</span> or sand, and, therefore, they will not develop flaws. If they they develop some <span class="sup">flaws</span>, you can remove them with a <span class="tl">burin</span> called <span class="tl">chaple</span> which has a tip like a small <span class="tl">chisel</span>.

## For grottoes

 
<span class="m">Stone</span>s made from water called <span class="m">stuf</span>; <span class="m">charcoal</span>; the confection of <span class="m">tin</span> and pure <span class="m">brass</span>; <span class="m">paper</span> ground up and mixed with ground up <span class="m">glass</span>; <span class="m">cork</span>; <span class="m">heated parchment</span>, <span class="sup">and</span> <span class="m">white coral</span>, all of them are appropriate for making grottoes. But, once dry, bizarre pieces of <span class="m">wood</span>, which [the bizarre pieces of wood] are found in the forests and among <span class="sup">regular</span> mushrooms and <span class="pa">potirons</span> <span class="sup">growing on</span> trees, are better than all of them because they are light. Mix in with small pieces of <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> which have a shiny luster. Grind in a little of a different kind of <span class="m">marcasite</span> in order to clean the <span class="m">earth</span> away, then powder the work, which is very beautiful. If there is no spring in the grotto, glue all of this with strong <span class="m">glue</span>, and then the work is done. You must show all kinds of <span class="m">mines</span>. The <span class="m">sulfurous marcasites</span> which do not have a grain but are even like <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> are very beautiful.

## <span class="m">Looking—glass tin</span>

 
If one ounce of <span class="sup"><span class="m">looking—glass tin</span></span> is put in with it <span class="sup">pure <span class="m">tin</span></span>, pure <span class="m">tin</span> whitens and becomes firm, that is, i ℥ of <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> in one <span class="ms">lb</span> of pure <span class="m">tin</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Salt ammoniac</span>

 
<span class="m">Salt ammoniac water</span> is naturally quite good for <span class="tl">casting</span> in <span class="m">gold</span> and in <span class="m">silver</span>.
