## Blacks

 
Coal black, ordinary black lead black, burnt ivory black, peaches stones black, black smoke, black light, burnt oxes' feet bones black

 
  

## Shadows

 
When you are making a painting with several persons shadows as well as skins have to be different

 
  

## Frescoes 

 
<span class="m">Azure</span> is not good for that but [illegible] and you have to work with long brushes. Frescoes cannot be made on <span class="m">wood</span>

 
  

## <span class="m">Azure</span>

 
<span class="m">Turpentine oil</span> makes it very beautiful, try some <span class="m">palma christi seed oil</span>. <span class="m">Nut oil</span> in <span class="pl">Flanders</span> costs at least a hundred sols a pint. The <span class="m">azur</span> requires some greasy <span class="m">oil</span> for it is not thick

>   <span class="m">Enamel azur</span> hates more than any other to be ground, even with some <span class="m">water</span> for it dies and loses all its color. Because however it cannot be used if it is big, grind it not with some water but with some oil and grind it thickly and so it will not die

## Brushes 

 
When the color has dried inside them and you want to clean them soak them in some <span class="m">spike lavender oil</span> and they will turn immediately soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in some <span class="m">nut oil</span>. <span class="m">Nut oil</span>is not as appropriate to soften them as the <span class="m">spike lavender</span> one which is clear like water and penetrates and is not as thick as the <span class="m">nut oil</span>. Brush handles are made by those who work with care from <span class="al">porcupine</span> hairs, by some others from fine branches of <span class="pl">Turkish</span> <span class="m">wood</span> with which they also make small sticks to rest their hand when they are painting

>   To work properly on small scale you need some very fine brushes with a strong point. And because the <span class="m">hair</span> taken from a <span class="al">squirrel</span>'s tale is mollesin, the most careful ones use the of oldest <span class="m"><span class="al">rats</span>' hair</span> and even of <span class="al">dormouses</span> if they can find some and put two or three in the middle of a brush. These brushes draw a straight line like a quill and all the other <span class="m">hairs</span> stick to them. The <span class="m">hair of a <span class="al">stone marten</span></span> or of a <span class="al">weasel</span> and small animals used to make some <span class="m">musk</span> are even better for just one <span class="m">hair</span> is necessary in a brush
