the crucible is red. Next, throw it on a marble, and you will have a white, hard & uniform matter, like <span class="m">alabaster</span>, from which you will be able to cast medals which will look like marble; but guard them from humidity.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Jacinth</span>

 
It is made, like <span class="m">rubies</span>, with <span class="m">gold</span>; but you do not need such a great fire. <span class="m">Rubies</span> want fire for a whole day, and if there is not enough fire, it will only have red veins.

## <span class="m">Topaz</span>

 
I melted one part of calcinated & pulverized <span class="m">pumice stone</span> with three parts of <span class="m">minium</span>, the stone having been pulverized in a steel mortar. A very beautiful yellow came to me, without any grain more yellow than the others. It is true that it was strongly charged with colour. I believe it would be better to pulverize the <span class="m">pumice</span> in a glass mortar, because it & the <span class="m">minium</span> make enough yellow by themselves. A mass came to me, the top of which was the beautiful yellow, as mentioned, and the bottom was like a <span class="m">fire—stone</span> without transparency. With which, in mixing other
 
 
  

## Varnish

 
The Germans thoroughly boil the <span class="m">minium</span> in <span class="m">linseed oil</span>, & to give it the body of varnish, they mix in thoroughly pulverized <span class="m">yellow amber</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Ammoniacum</span>

 
One puts it by small lumps into a bit of good <span class="m">vinegar</span>, & heats it, then passes it through a cloth strainer. All medicinal <span class="m">gums</span> dissolve in <span class="m">vinegar</span>.
