## Working neatly

 
If you can avoid it, never apply two colors on top of one another. But after making your drawing with great care, keep the shadowed areas separate for themselves and the lights and highlights as well, particularly without smoothly laying a color, then add to this highlighting or shading. And in this way, you further your hard work, spare your colours and work cleanly, which as a result, the colors are not muddled nor mixed together, they do not decay and you soften then better, thus finding it not so thick.

## <span class="m">Yellow ochre</span>

 You need a bit in every flesh tone.

## Softening

 One softens in the same way on <span class="m">oil paper</span> as on <span class="m">wood</span>. But it is easier to soften on <span class="m">canvas</span>, because the softening must be coarse there.
 
 
  

## Greasy <span class="m">oil</span>

 
Greasy <span class="m">oil</span> does not work well with colors because it makes them thick, and as difficult to work as <span class="m">azur enamel</span>. Thus use the clearest and freshest <span class="m">walnut oil</span> that you can.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Vermilion</span>

 
It must not be kept in <span class="m">water</span> when crushed with <span class="m">oil</span> because it loses its color. It is better to choose <span class="m">whitish vermilion</span> than <span class="m">dark vermilion</span> or or a <span class="m">blackish vermilion</span>. Because <span class="m">vermilion</span> is commonly mixed with a little <span class="m">lake</span>, otherwise it would hardly be different from <span class="m">minium</span>. But the pale one shows more vividly than the dark one. It does not dry by itself, so for that effect one mixes in <span class="m">calcined crystal</span>.

## Eyes

 An eye must always follow the circle of the compass and not be flat or square.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Oil colors</span> in <span class="m">water</span>

 
Commonly, after crushing them one puts a piece of <span class="m">tin leaf</span> on top, and one puts them into <span class="m">water</span> to keep them from drying out. But this is more appropriate for <span class="m">white lead</span>, <span class="m">minium</span> and <span class="m">massicot</span> than for the others, for <span class="m">lake</span> fades and loses its color, as does <span class="m">azure vermillion</span>.
 
 
  

## Double layer

 
<span class="m">Verdigris</span> does not fade, and therefore does not need to be applied twice. But <span class="m">lake</span> and others, especially flesh tone, need two layers. Colors hardly change once they are dry.
