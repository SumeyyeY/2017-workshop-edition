## Molding <span class="m">sulfur</span>

 
<span class="m">Sulfur</span> is made beautiful mixed with <span class="m">soot black</span> or <span class="m">pulverized bloodstone</span>, which makes it harder and stronger. Having let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like <span class="m">oil</span>, mix it with <span class="m">verdigris</span>, and you <span class="del">m</span> will cast in <span class="m">plaster</span> very cleanly a <span class="al">lizard</span>, or something else.
 
> *at left top margin*
> 
> 
>   You must not cast it until it is well cooled & has lost all of its lumps & bubbles, and it has settled down & become even like <span class="del">[illegible]</span> <span class="m">water</span>. The <span class="m">soot black</span> gives it a fine luster & makes it neater. The most beautiful yellow <span class="m">sulfur</span> must be used, for the greyish & lively <span class="m">sulfur</span> is not good. Do not cast <span class="env">in wind</span> & <span class="env">cold</span>, for it would become porous.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Cimolee</span>

 
<span class="m">Cimolee</span>, otherwise known as <span class="m"><span class="pro">fuller</span>’s earth</span>, which prepares <span class="m">cloth</span>, is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; & if you want to reheat it, it must first be warm, & reheat it gently on low, indirect flame, & little by little, otherwise it would crack. Put the figure for reheating in a <span class="tl">pot</span> in an <span class="tl">oven</span>, or in a <span class="tl">covered oven</span>. It is very malleable, clean & fine. <span class="add">You can make a hollow for animals of <span class="m">cimolee</span> & cast <span class="m">lead</span> in it.</span>
 
> *at left middle margin*
> 
> 
>   The work needs to be dry for 4 or 5 <span class="ms">days</span> before you reheat it. When you mold & make a hollow in <span class="m">cimolee</span>, do not press too hard, but gently, for it would crack.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Paper</span>

 
The whitest & finest is the best. And when the cavity is quite clean, as that of <span class="m">sulfur</span> or <span class="m">baked cimolee</span>, it is made very neatly. You can give it one or two layers of <span class="m">white</span> with a border of <span class="m">gold</span> to imitate <span class="m">alabaster</span>. And after applying the <span class="m">white</span>, you may burnish it with a <span class="tl">tooth</span>. But in order for it to be burnished, one needs to soak the <span class="m">lead white</span> with <span class="m">egg white</span> & <span class="m">peelings from the <span class="pa">fig tree</span></span>. Or better, varnish your work with <span class="m">white varnish</span>. In addition when you are molding with <span class="m">paper</span>, as it starts to dry, burnish from the back with the <span class="tl">tooth</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Plaster</span>

 
<span class="env">Mountain</span> <span class="m">plaster</span> is greyer, and <span class="del">the</span> the one from the region of <span class="pl">Albi</span> is whiter. It must be heated over a closed fire, such as a <span class="tl">reverberatory furnace</span> or <span class="tl">fours de barbiers</span>. And the best to work with is the most recently heated one. It must be finely ground on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>. After preparing your hollow mold with <span class="m">sulfur</span> or something else, & <span class="m">oiling</span> it, & investing with a circle, temper not too thickly your <span class="m">plaster</span> with <span class="m">water</span>, & stir it well with your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span>, and if it makes lumps, throw in more <span class="m">powder of the said plaster</span> & <span class="del">[illegible]</span> grind it with your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span> until \+
 
> *at left bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   \+ it makes no more lumps. Then immediately throw in & sprinkle <span class="m">plaster powder</span> & leave to set well, then scrape the powder off.
