## Faces painted with <span class="m">distemper</span>

 
Because colors painted with <span class="m">distemper</span> dry quickly and one would not have enough time to complete the shadows and touches on the face, one wets the reverse of the face, on <span class="m">canvas</span>, with a wet <span class="tl">sponge</span>. Then, with a small <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, one makes the shadows, which won't come off. Next, one lays the flesh tones, which do not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And then, one retouches the more prominent areas with lively flesh tones. And with another <span class="tl">pinceau</span> one retouches the shadows in hatching. The shadow strokes do not come off because they are made of <span class="m">bister</span>, which stains the <span class="m">canvas</span> like rust. The said <span class="m">bister</span> is good for making shadows with <span class="m">distemper</span>, for in <span class="m">oil</span> it has no body and would dry with great difficulty. One mixes <span class="m">ru ochre</span> in the said <span class="m">bister</span> for shadows with a little <span class="m">sap green</span>. The best <span class="m">bister</span> is the rich, shiny one from the fireplaces of large kitchens. It is difficult to grind and screeches on the <span class="m">marble</span> slab.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Azure</span>

 
<span class="m">Azur desmail</span> always wants to be cleaned because the filth that can be seen in the used water <span class="sup">would</span> makes it die. It always needs to be coated twice, & first very thickly, driving the <span class="tl">pinceau</span> by laying it lengthwise then across. It is better used on <span class="m">canvas</span>, which imbibes it immediately, than on <span class="m">wood</span>. <span class="m">Varnish</span> restores its vigor, because while imbibing, it becomes dark. To try it, <span class="pro">painters</span> bring their palettes to the <span class="pro">grocers</span> and distemper and mix @ it with a bit of <span class="m">white</span> crushed in <span class="m">oil</span>, for in this way the beautiful shows its turquine vivacity, while the mediocre is lavender grey. The thinner one is best to work with. It is made thinner by being washed.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Purple</span> and <span class="m">lake</span>

 
It is made of <span class="m">azure</span> and <span class="m">lake</span> which is also tested on the palette with <span class="m">white</span>. The one which gives a clear red rose color, tending slightly towards purple, on a <span class="m">polished knife</span> or on <span class="m">glass</span>, is esteemed beautiful. The dark red one is not as pleasant.
