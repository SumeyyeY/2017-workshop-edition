## Faces painted with <span class="m">distemper</span>

 
Because colors painted with <span class="m">distemper</span> dry quickly & one would not have enough time to complete the shadows and touches on the face, one wets the reverse of the face, on <span class="m">canvas</span>, with a wet <span class="tl">sponge</span>. Then, with a small <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, one makes the shadows, which won't come off. Next, one lays the flesh tones, which do not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And then, one retouches the more prominent areas with lively flesh tones. And with another <span class="tl">pinceau</span> one retouches the shadows in hatching. The shadow strokes do not come off because they are made of <span class="m">bister</span>, which stains the <span class="m">canvas</span> like rust. The said <span class="m">bister</span> is good for making shadows with <span class="m">distemper</span>, for in <span class="m">oil</span> it has no body and would dry with great difficulty. One mixes <span class="m">ru ochre</span> in the said <span class="m">bister</span> for shadows with a little <span class="m">sap green</span>. The best <span class="m">bister</span> is the rich, shiny one from the fireplaces of large kitchens. It is difficult to grind and screeches on the <span class="m">marble</span> slab.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Azure</span>

 
<span class="m">Azur d’esmail</span> always wants to be cleaned because the filth that can be seen in the laveures makes it die. One needs to coat it two times, & the first very thick, moving the <span class="tl">pinceau</span> by laying it first lengthwise then across.  It is better used on <span class="m">canvas</span>, where it is imbibed immediately, than on <span class="m">wood</span>. <span class="m">Varnish</span> returns it to its vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To try it, <span class="pro">painters</span> bring their <span class="tl">palette</span> to the <span class="pro">grocers</span>, & distemper & alloy it with a little white crushed in <span class="m">oil</span>, for in this way, the beautiful shows its turquine vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most delicate is the best for working. It is thinned <span class="del">working</span> by washing it.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Purple</span> and <span class="m">lake</span>

 
It is made of <span class="m">azure</span> and <span class="m">lake</span> which is also tested on the palette with <span class="m">white</span>. The one which gives a clear red rose color, tending slightly towards purple, on a <span class="m">polished knife</span> or on <span class="m">glass</span>, is esteemed beautiful. The dark red one is not as pleasant.
