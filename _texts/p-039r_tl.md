## <span class="pro">Goldsmith</span>

 
They assemble <span class="m">silver filings</span> with <span class="m">saltpeter</span> which refines it & does not make it brittle. But <span class="m">gold filings</span> are assembled with <span class="m">borax</span> or, to spare the <span class="m">borax</span>, with <span class="m">lead</span>, which refines the <span class="m">gold</span> & softens it, for the <span class="m">saltpeter</span> would make it brittle, which <span class="m">silver</span> does not do. This is why, to save money, <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> use it to assemble, in order to spare <span class="m">borax</span>, which costs viii <span class="cn">sols</span> per <span class="ms">ounce</span>, & <span class="m">saltpeter</span> x <span class="cn">sols</span> per <span class="ms">lb</span>.
 
When <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> have thus assembled their <span class="m">silver filings</span> with <span class="m">saltpeter</span>, a <span class="m">red enamel</span> vitrifies at the bottom of the <span class="tl">crucible</span>. I do not know if the <span class="m">copper</span> mixed in with the <span class="m">silver</span> is the cause. Try for <span class="m">enamel</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="pa">Dyers’ woad</span></span>

 
It is grown in <span class="pl">Lauragais</span> where the deep soil is so fertile that every year wheat was grown there, it would lie flat for being too vigorous. This is why <span class="m">dyers’ woad</span> and wheat are grown there alternately. For cultivating <span class="m">dyers’ woad</span>, the soil is ploughed with <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> shovels</span>, as <span class="pro">gardeners</span> do. Next, it is harrowed with <span class="tl">rakes</span>, & broken up finely as for sowing some <span class="pa">kitchen herbs</span>. It is commonly sown on <span class="tmp">Saint Anthony's day in January</span>. Eight harvests are made. The first ones are better. The best <span class="m">dyers’ woad</span> of <span class="pl">Lauragais</span> is the one from <span class="pl">Carmail</span> & the one from <span class="pl">Auragne</span>. And sometimes the <span class="m">dyers’ woad</span> is good in one field & in the one close by it will hardly have worth. The goodness of the <span class="m">dyers’ woad</span> can be recognized when put in the mouth it gives the taste of <span class="m">vinegar</span>, or when crumbling & breaking it, it has some mold—like veins which are as it were golden or silver. It is assayed in the <span class="tl"><span class="pro">dyers</span>' vat</span>, and to fill a <span class="tl">vat</span> with it, six <span class="ms">bales</span> of it are needed. There several flocks of <span class="m">wool</span> are dyed, and if it dyes fifteen times, it is said to be worth 15 <span class="cn">florins</span>, if it gives xx dyings, xx <span class="cn">florins</span>. The good kind dyes up to 30 times & commonly up to xxv or 26.
