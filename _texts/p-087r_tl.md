*[continued]*
  
In order to mold well, it is necessary to cast several medals together in a large box mold, because when there is a lot of material & the crucible is almost full, it becomes hotter. & Then, if you do not succeed with one of the medals, another will be good.
 
It is better to melt with a bellows furnace than with a wind furnace, because it heats more vigorously. It is true that <span class="m">latten</span> melts better in the wind furnace, because it is more brittle than <span class="m">copper</span>.
 
Some <span class="pro">founder</span>s superstitiously believe that there are only three days in a week that are good for melting, that is, Tuesdays, <span class="del">Wednesdays</span> Thursdays, and Saturdays. For them, the others are unlucky.
 
When you mold, do not excessively pound on the medal that is in <span class="m">sand</span>, because that prevents it from being cleanly stripped, & cracks the mold.
 
See to it that <span class="m">sand</span> does not go over the edges of the box mold, because if the molded medal is higher than the cast, <span class="m">metal</span> will not easily enter the form. Therefore, always take care that the surface of your cast surpasses the mold in a straight line. To accomplish this, if you wish, put a piece of <span class="m">cardboard</span> of whatever thickness you please on top of the mold.
 
To prevent their large casting works from becoming too porous, <span class="pro">founder</span>s are careful to heat their molds very well. And to know if the molds are heated enough, they tap them with their finger, & if they start ringing like a pot, they are heated enough.
 
In order to cast their canons cleanly, they mix with their <span class="m"><span class="pro">founder</span>'s earth</span> some fine casting <span class="m">sand</span>, if they can get any.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span> of <span class="pl">Toulouse</span>

 
<span class="del"></span>The <span class="sup"><span class="m">sand</span></span> generally considered good is the one found in a vineyard near Pech—David. But the best is the one is from the <span class="pl">Touch</span>, a river close to <span class="pl">Saint—Michel</span> & <span class="pl">Blagnac</span>, in a vineyard at a high altitude. This <span class="sup"><span class="m">sand</span></span> is thinner, & a bit greasier than the other, & better for small works. It should not be overheated.
