When you have molded, it is good to reheat your mold on the <span class="m">smoke</span> of the substance you are melting, because the cast absorbs the quality o<span class="del">e</span><span class="add">f</span> the <span class="m">metal</span>, which runs afterwards more easily in something that comes from it.
 
 <span class="m">Human bones</span> are the best for casting once calcined.
 
To cast neatly, it is necessary that your substance be quite hot & to achieve this, when your substance is melted, throw in some <span class="m">iron scales</span>, or in powder or otherwise <span class="del">E</span>, for it heats copper a lot & cleanses it of its fat. At the end, when you want to cast, add some <span class="m">saltpeter</span>, by folding your additions in a paper so that others not know what you are adding.
 
<span class="m">Sheep foot bones</span> are even better than the <span class="m">ox foot bones</span>.
 
<span class="m">Oil</span> and <span class="m">tallow</span> make it really porous & <span class="m">crushed glass</span> & <span class="m">copper</span> alone.
 
<span class="m">Cendreée earth</span> molds very neatly.
 
<span class="m">Ashes</span> do not have enough body to withstand <span class="m">copper</span>.
 
It is best not to mix the <span class="m">sands</span>, but fill the box mold with one only..
 
<span class="m">Latten</span> is always fat, & does not mold neatly. One finds that it comes out better alloyed with a quarter of <span class="m">copper</span>, but it needs to be cast very hot.
 
<span class="m">Copper</span> comes out well with a bit of <span class="m">metal</span>. If you mix in <span class="m">metal</span> within <span class="m">latten</span>, it will be more brittle & more troublesome.
 
A slightly coarser <span class="m">sand</span> has more body.
 
<span class="m">Sand from <span class="del">corp</span> rock</span> is always better, which seems like tuf in lumps, which has a beautiful & very fine grain, & a little fat. One crushes it, then one dries it in a skillet on the fire, until it <span class="del">is</span> stops smoking, then one passes it through through a double sieve & fine, & one molds with it.

>   <span class="m">Copper</span> or <span class="m">latten</span> cannot come out well if the medal does not sufficient thickness, & if it does not have it, give it some with some <span class="m">wax</span>.

> *at left middle margin*
> 
> 
>   Some wanting to cast large works in <span class="m">latten</span> mix in the <span class="m">sand</span> some crushed<span class="m">glass</span> to give the <span class="m">earth</span> some bond. But it makes it porous, and needs to be repaired.
 
> *at left bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   One puts in <span class="m">lead</span> for a large work to make it run, but not <span class="del">not<br/> for</span> in a small one because it would leave filth all around the work.
