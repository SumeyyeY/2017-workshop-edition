## Double layers

 
The <span class="pl">Flemish</span> & those who paint paintings by the dozen only apply one layer & finish in one go. But the colors soon die. And when they are laid twice, they will not die. One needs to lay them lightly & with minimal thickness, in order to soften them.
 
 
  

## Shadows

 
For women: <span class="m">asphaltum</span>, <span class="m">umber</span> and a little <span class="m">lake</span>.
 
 
  

## Painting in distemper on <span class="m">wood</span>

 
Because it is quite tedious to paint in distemper on <span class="m">wood</span>, and difficult to paint a face well, some mix their colors with <span class="m">egg white</span> seeped through a sponge, or mixed with the <span class="m"><span class="sup">egg</span> yolk</span>, <span class="m">water</span>, and well beaten with the <span class="m">peeling of the fig tree</span>. With this they paint & soften on the <span class="m">wood</span>, like with <span class="m">oil</span>, and this supports the varnish, but this does not last.
 
 
  

## Colors in <span class="m">oil</span> that are imbibed

 
It is best that colors in <span class="m">oil</span> are imbibed, that is to say they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the <span class="m">oil</span> has remained in that part which would make the colors die. The varnish mends all this & unites & renders it similar in one place as in another.
 
One needs <span class="m">gold</span> color to be laid down thick, for if it is clear, it would be imbibed & would run.
 
On <span class="m">canvas</span> & in distemper, one <span class="m">gilds</span> with <span class="m">bole</span> & <span class="m">honey</span> & a little <span class="m">garlic juice</span>.
 
 
  

## Gilding painting mounts with <span class="m">or</span> mat

 
See the other side of this folio this mark: *
 
The <span class="pl">Flemish</span> give one layer of distempered <span class="m">glue</span> on the mount, then they mix <span class="m">lamp black</span> or <span class="m">soot black</span> with the same <span class="m">glue</span> & leave to dry. Next, they pounce some moresque designs in the corners & paint them with <span class="m">minium</span>, <span class="m">massicot</span>, <span class="m">ochre de ru</span>, and a bit of <span class="m">yellow ocher</span>, mixed with the <span class="m">fatty oil</span> in which they clean their <span class="m">oil</span> brushes, because the three aforesaid colors are griping and dry immediatly. And next, they apply the <span class="m">gold</span>, then varnish on top of everything. And it seems by this way to some, that all of the black is painted in <span class="m">oil</span>, but that would not be good because the <span class="m">gold</span> attaches everywhere, and not only on the moresque.

It is made with <span class="m">massicot</span>, <span class="m">minium</span>, <span class="m">ochre de ru</span>, & <span class="m">yellow ocher</span>, so that the composition resembles <span class="m">gold</span>. Gild the day after <span class="del">un jo</span> it is applied, if you <span class="del">in the</span> made the groundlayer the <span class="sup">same</span> evening as the color. Next, having gilded, leave it to dry & rest for one day. Next, rub the gilding with a <span class="tl">feather</span> & <span class="tl">cotton</span>, so that no small flakes remains, then varnish with <span class="m"><span class="pl">Flanders</span> varnish</span>, which you make, mixed with a little <span class="m">spirit</span>, to make it desiccative.
 
The varnish will dry in an hour. It will enhance the <span class="m">gold</span> color. And this <span class="m">or</span> mat withstands rain, even if one rubs it, but it must be well dry, for eight or ten days.
 <span class="m">Gold</span> color that is made of various colors cleaned from <span class="m">oil</span> brushes is not so good & with time tarnishes the <span class="m">gold</span> because of the <span class="m">verdigris</span>. One must not touch with the <span class="bp">finger</span> the layer made for the <span class="m">gold</span> because that will prevent it from attaching itself there. The <span class="m">or moulu</span> spoils if <span class="m">water</span> touches it, but <span class="m">or</span> mat withstands well the rain & in <span class="m">water</span>. One must not burnish it, because the <span class="tl">tooth</span> would remove it. Collect the small flakes & small bits that the <span class="tl">cotton</span> removed when the <span class="m">gold</span> is dry and that you clean it, for as little as an <span class="ms">ounce</span> is still <span class="m">gold</span>. In <span class="pl">Flanders</span>, women <span class="del">make</span> <span class="m">gild</span>. It is more beautiful when it is a little thick but in <span class="pl">France</span> they beat it too delicately. 
Breathe on the <span class="m">gold</span> color, and if it loses its shine, it is dry enough, but if does not welcome the vapor of the breath, it is not yet dry enough.
 
One should not do <span class="m">or</span> mat gilding after <span class="del">with</span> having applied <span class="m">gold</span> color, but wait one day and one night, <span class="del">but take heed to not</span> and, when it appears to be dry, it will grip the gold. Next, one varnishes.
