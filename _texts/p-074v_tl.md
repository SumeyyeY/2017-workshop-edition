fire until it is cooked enough. And strain it through a cloth that is compact enough. And when you have strained it, leave it to cool a little. And if you see that it is so thick that you cannot strain it, you will add a little of that oil and will make it better. 
 
 
  

## To make red varnish

 
Take <span class="m">vermillion</span>, and let it <span class="del"></span> soak in quite light <span class="m">gum water</span>, like the other, and make two or three ground layers as is said above. 
 
 
  

## To make yellow varnish

 
Take some <span class="m">gum arabic</span> and let it soak in <span class="m">water</span>, then take some well beaten saffran and soak said <span class="m">gum</span>. And make it quite light, then make your ground layer on that which you want to varnish, and leave it to dry, and when it will be dry give another ground layer of the same [varnish], and leave it to dry as before, until it will be dry enough. Then take varnish from an apothecary, crushed by strokes far enough from one another. Then wash your hands quite well and spread your varnish with their palms. 
 
 
  

## Recipe for white <span class="m">gum</span>

 
Take white <span class="m">wax</span> and <span class="m">ceruse</span> and a little fine <span class="m">pitch</span>, very well pounded together, and put it in a small new pot and make it melt. And when it will be melted you will make a palette of <span class="m">wood</span> <span class="del"></span> and burnish what you want. 
 
 
  

## Green <span class="m">gum</span>

 
Take green <span class="m">wax</span> with a little <span class="m">verdigris</span> and make it melt as said above.
