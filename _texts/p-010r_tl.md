## Imitation <span class="m">jasper</span>

 
Take <span class="m">horn</span> as is used to make lanterns, quite thin, and underneath imitate your <span class="m">jasper</span>, <span class="m">cornaline</span>, and other <span class="m">stones</span>. That will look more appropriate than doing it on glass, which is too shiny. And the <span class="m">horn</span> gives a lustre and a fatty polish similar to <span class="m">jasper</span>.
 
You know how you can imitate <span class="m"><span class="pa">rose</span></span>s with scrapings of the said <span class="m">horn</span>. The colors for this <span class="m">jasper</span> need to have as a base clear <span class="m">turpentine</span> or <span class="m">spike lavender</span> varnish. And matte, opaque colours are not appropriate, no matter how fine they are. You have to <span class="m">oil</span> the unpainted underside with <span class="m">spike lavender oil</span>.

>  You can inlay beds with it, and on the joints you can throw the filings of <span class="m">talc</span> or of <span class="m">pins</span> on the fresh <span class="m">cement</span> of the said joints. You have to bond them with <span class="m">gum amoniacum</span> soaked in <span class="m">vinegar</span>. To better imitate <span class="m">marbled jasper</span>, apply coarse<span class="m">wool</span> hair dyed various colors and intermingled. After you have laid down all the colors, scrape oblique lines into them then lay down<span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span> leaves. If you lay down colors made of <span class="m">turpentine</span> on the <span class="m">horn</span>, give it a backing of <span class="m">silver</span> or of <span class="m">tin</span> leaf<span class="m">.</span> You can also file <span class="m">horn</span> and mix it with <span class="m">strong glue</span> and lay it down onto the joints of the piece of <span class="m">horn</span> and finish with a <span class="tl">joiner's plane</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Stil de grain yellow</span>

 
It is made in <span class="pl">Lyon</span> from the <span class="m">juice of weld</span> & <span class="m">chalk</span> mixed together or better yet with <span class="m">ceruse</span>, which is appropriate for <span class="m">distemper</span> and <span class="m">oil</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="pa">Roses</span>

 
These are imitated either with the scrapings of <span class="del">[illegible]</span> <span class="m">horn used for lanterns</span>, or with scrapings of very clear, delicate & dyed <span class="m">parchment</span>, used as you know.
 
 
  

## Purple color

 
<span class="pro">Painters</span> make it beautifully by making the first ground layer of <span class="m">common azur</span>, or better yet <span class="m">azur d'esmail</span>, & next they glaze it with <span class="m">lake</span>, which will be more appropriate for this if you mix in <span class="m">alum</span>, which gives it a violet tint depending on the quantity that you mix in.

## Powder for hourglasses

 
It must be made very fine and not subject to rust and with enough weight to flow. Taking i <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">lead</span>, melt it and skim and purify it from its filth, then pour into it four ℥ of finely ground <span class="m">common salt</span>, and take care that there are no <span class="m">stones</span> or earth. And immediately after pouring it, stir continuously very well with an <span class="m">iron</span> <span class="sup">tool</span> until the <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">salt</span> are quite incorporated, and take it immediately off the fire, stirring continuously. And if it seems too coarse, grind it on a <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span> slab</span> and pass it through a fine <span class="tl">sieve</span>, then wash it as many as times as necessary until the <span class="m">water</span> runs clear, throwing out the fine powder that will float on it, renewing the <span class="m">water</span> as many times as necessary until it is completely cleared.
