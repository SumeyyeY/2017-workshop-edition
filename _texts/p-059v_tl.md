## Painting weapons

 
<span class="m">Black charcoal</span> mixed with <span class="m">white lead</span> is very appropriate for painting weapons, also mixing in a little <span class="m">azure</span> if you wish. <span class="m">Charcoal</span> by itself is somewhat bluish.
 
 
  

## Painting crepe

 
First you need to make a greyish background using <span class="m">charcoal black</span> mixed with <span class="m">white lead</span> and a little <span class="m">azure</span>. Then, after drying, highlight with strokes and lines in <span class="m">white lead</span>.
 
 
  

## Folds in clothing

 
You must take care not to represent any <span class="sup">folds</span> falsely, but rather imitate natural effects. Thick cloth hardly makes any folds, <span class="m">taffetas</span> and <span class="m">silk</span> cloth make more, and <span class="m">crepe</span> more still. Observe which folds go lengthwise and which across.
 
 
  

## Siccatives

 
<span class="m">White lead</span> and <span class="m">massicot</span> are most siccative, nevertheless they need a good two days. If you want to verify whether an <span class="m">oil</span> is siccative, use it to distemper <span class="m">white lead</span>, and if it soon produces a crust it means that it will dry.
 
 
  

## Double layers

 
<span class="m">Azures</span>, flesh tones and reds are applied twice. Other <span class="sup">colors</span> are not.
 
 
  

## Mending cracks in a panel

 
If a painted panel breaks you can glue it well on the reverse, but to fill in the cracks properly in order to paint and repair it, you must not use any <span class="m">glue </span>, which weakens in damp weather and would swell when touched with the <span class="m">oil</span> of the painting. But have some <span class="m">white wax</span>, which is harder than the other sort. The <span class="m">oil</span> mixed into the <span class="m">wax</span> prevents it from melting in the sun. The <span class="m">wax</span> must not be hard, but soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks and crevices with the tip of a knife, then scrape.
