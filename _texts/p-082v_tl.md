## <span class="pro">Watchmakers</span>

 
Formerly, they dipping their springs by immersing them into <span class="m">molten lead</span>. Today they dip their straight springs, & afterwards bend them, which is a beautiful secret.
 
 
  

## Casting <span class="m">lead</span> in <span class="m">lead</span>

 
Some make their caves with <span class="m">lead</span>, they make them thick, and then cast <span class="m">lead</span> in it.<br/> <span class="m">Lead</span> that is not cast hot enough is white, & darker when cast very hot.

## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
If <span class="m">sand</span> is too fat it should be reheated and sifted again.
 
 
  

## Ways of <span class="m">bronze</span> casting

 
<span class="m">Laiton de potin</span>, which is the most acid, moulds neater than <span class="m">latten of cassole</span> according to many people. All <span class="m">fine latten</span> molds cleaner than <span class="m">red copper</span>. If you want to cast something fragile & tenuous, the secret is casting as hot as possible so that the matter boils. You will know that it is hot enough when it <span class="m">smoke</span>s a lot and stirring it makes sparks. For heating well you should place your crucible as low as possible & close to the forging mill, so that the <span class="m">bellows</span> blow on the middle of the crucible, thus it heats better than on the grate on which we <span class="add">usually</span>put the crucible, under which the bellows blow. It is true that the crucible can easily break but you can lute it as you know <span class="pro">founders</span> do. You need to keep feeding <span class="add">the fire</span>with <span class="m">coals</span>, which are between the bellows & the crucible. Make sure to cast all at once & not in increments & drop by drop, otherwise the conduit will be plugged by the matter. It is better to make an <span class="pro">abreveoir</span> to <span class="pro">abreuver</span> the medal. It is necessary that you stir the melted matter with a stick, so that the matter at the bottom heats well. Because <span class="m">Iron</span> turns the matter acid. Turn

>   <span class="m">Copper</span> matter is good to cast because when broken, its grain is long & not short, that shows that the matter is soft. The matter is composed half of <span class="m">fine latten</span> & half of <span class="m">red copper</span>. This long grain is called longue tige <span class="add">long rod</span>.
