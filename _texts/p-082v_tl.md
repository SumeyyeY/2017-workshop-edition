## <span class="pro">Watchmakers</span>

 
Formerly, they dipping their springs by immersing them into <span class="m">molten lead</span>. Today they dip their straight springs, & afterwards bend them, which is a beautiful secret.
 
 
  

## Casting <span class="m">lead</span> in <span class="m">lead</span>

 
There are some who make their cavities with thick <span class="m">lead</span>, then cast <span class="m">lead</span> in them.<br/> <span class="m">Lead</span> when not cast hot enough, is white, & blacker when cast well hot.

## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
If it is too fat, one ought to reheat it and sieve it again.
 
 
  

## Ways of casting in <span class="m">bronze</span>

 
<span class="m">Latten of  potin</span> <span class="del">cor</span>, which is the most brittle, molds more neatly, according to the opinion of many people, than fine <span class="m">latten of skillets</span>, just like all <span class="m">fine latten</span> molds neater than <span class="m">red copper</span>. If you want to cast something fine & thin, the entire secret is to cast as hot as possible so that the substance boils. You will recognize that it is hot enough when it <span class="m">smoke</span>s a lot and while stirring it throws sparks. To heat well, place your crucible as low as possible & at the very bottom of the forge, so that the <span class="m">bellows</span> <span class="del">fra</span> beat on the middle of the crucible, for in this way it is better than on the grill on which one <span class="add">usually</span> puts the crucible, under which the bellows beat. It is true that the crucible risks more danger breaking, but you can lute it as you know <span class="pro">founders</span> do. And also, one ought to maintain <span class="add">the charcoal</span>between the bellows & the crucible. Also take heed to cast all at once & not in increments & drop by drop, which would stop and plug up the conduit of the substance. And if make in the cast an <span class="pro">abreveoir</span> to <span class="pro">abreuver</span> the medal, it would be even better. And so that the substance heats well at the bottom, stir it, once melted, with a wood stick, for iron only makes it brittle. Turn.

>   The <span class="m">copper</span> substance is found to be good for casting, when once broken it makes the grain long & not short, for it demonstrates that it is soft. It is half <span class="m">fine latten</span> & half <span class="m">red copper</span>. This long grain is called long stalk.
