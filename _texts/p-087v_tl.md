## <span class="m">Sand</span>, <span class="m">slate</span>, and burned <span class="m">earth</span>

 
<span class="m">Sand</span>, when overheated, does not hold as well. <span class="m">Slate</span> is baked & will mold clean, yet it is true that often it becomes porous, just like burned <span class="m">earth</span> also does, as well as any kind of greasy <span class="m">sand</span>.

Still, it needs to be pressed hard, and moisten it sufficiently.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Magistry</span>

 
<span class="pro">Founders</span> harvest the <span class="m">roots of a young elm</span> when it is sappy, & boil it in <span class="m">wine</span>, or better yet <span class="m">vinegar</span>. They prepare a year's worth of it and store it in a cask.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span> from sand pit from <span class="pl">Toulouse</span>

 
<span class="sup">In order to use</span> <span class="m">sand</span> from a sandpit for casting, filter it through a double sieve, then having mixed it with molten <span class="m">resin</span> it burns & heats, & becomes all red & hot as iron. Once it has cooled down it is completely black and can be pulverised on <span class="m">porphyry</span> very well. Having prepared it like this & checked the smoothness of the surface with my nail, I moistened it with <span class="m">egg white</span> & beat it vigorously, until it was not a paste anymore but a powder. I found <span class="sup">this sand</span> to release the cast very well, & molded very clean in <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span> <span class="sup">with it</span>, however it needs to be reheated & at leisure.
 
Others beat it strongly in a mortar, in small amounts at a time, & thus it detaches and comes out very fine; then they bake it moderately, just enough to dry it, and then they crush it dry on <span class="m">porphyry</span>. Thus it is made almost impalpable, and yet not too dry <span class="del"></span>, and it retains the consistency & the binding quality of the <span class="m">earth</span> to which it is related, and is better than when it is burnt. When you moisten it with <span class="m">egg white</span> and pass it through a <span class="m">sponge</span> it releases <span class="del"></span> very clean for a low relief, but not a figure in high relief. Considering this, since then I experimented <span class="del"></span> with moistening it only with strong <span class="m">vinegar</span>. <span class="sup">That way</span> it releases a figure I previously had not been able to release <span class="sup">from the mold</span>. I think that even when you wet the finest sort with <span class="m">egg white</span>, or in a similar fashion, or the thick sort to fill chasses with <span class="m">water</span>, <span class="m">salt</span>, or <span class="m">vinegar</span>, they do not mix so well. However, given that they are of one and the same nature, & are similarly moistened, they espouse each other, & hold together.
 
 To mold well, when your <span class="m">sands</span> are prepared, mold in one day. Bake slowly the next day, then cast the other.

>   It is necessary to choose <span class="sup">sand</span> that <span class="del">like</span> comes in clods & lumps, and deep down in the earth, because commonly the one near the surface is too much akin to earth, whereas the deep one is similar to rock.

>   I have sometimes molded with <span class="m">pure lead</span> cast very <span class="del">clean</span> hot, & the example as well as the principal were very clean, but since the <span class="m">vinegar</span> gives it little binding, & it held only for one cast.
