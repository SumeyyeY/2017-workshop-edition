## <span class="m">Sand</span>, <span class="m">slate</span>, and burned <span class="m">earth</span>

 
Very burnt <span class="m">sand</span> looses its bond. <span class="m">Slate</span> is reheated & molds neatly. Next, it is true that often it becomes porous, like burned <span class="m">earth</span> also does, like fat <span class="m">sand</span> also does. .

## <span class="m">Magistry</span>

 
<span class="pro">Founders</span> take the <span class="m">roots of a young elm</span> when it has sap, & boil it in <span class="m">wine</span>, or better yet <span class="m">vinegar</span>, and keep it all year long in a cask.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span> from the mine of <span class="pl">Thoulouse</span>

 
 Casting sand coming from the mine, once passed through a double sieve, next put in with melted <span class="m">resin</span>, burns &inflammes & becomes all red & inflamed like iron. Once cold it is completely black and can be ground very finely on <span class="m">porphyry</span>. Thus having prepared it & render it without asperity on the fingernail, I moistened it with beaten egg glair & beat it well, until it was not pasty but rather powdery.I found it of very good release, & molded with it in <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span> very neatly, but it wants to be well reheated & at ease.
 
Others beat it well in a mortar, in small amounts at a time, & thus it detaches andrenders very finely. Then they reheat it moderately, only to dry it. Then they grind it dry on <span class="m">porphyry</span>. And thus it becomes as if impalpable, and not too dried out, <span class="del">it</span> and it retains body & bond of the <span class="m">earth</span> of which it is related, and is better than when it is very burnt. Once moistened with <span class="m">egg glair</span> wiped with a <span class="m">sponge</span>, it releases <span class="del">very neatly M</span> very neatly in low relief, but not for figures in high relief. Therefore, since then I experimented <span class="del">lexper</span> with moistening it only with very strong <span class="m">vinegar</span>. It released a figure which I could not release previously. And I believe that, moistening the finest in the same way like with glair & the lumpiest, to fill the chasses with salt water or wine, that they do not ally so well. Since they are of the same nature & are moistened the same, they embrace each other, & hold together one with the other.
 
 To mold well, after having prepared your <span class="m">sands</span>, mold in a day. Reheat Bake slowly the next day, then cast the other.

>   It is necessary to choose <span class="sup">sand</span> that <span class="del">like</span> comes in clods & lumps, and deep down in the earth, because commonly the one near the surface is too much akin to earth, whereas the deep one is similar to rock.

>   I have sometimes molded with <span class="m">pure lead</span> cast very <span class="del">clean</span> hot, & the example as well as the principal were very clean, but since the <span class="m">vinegar</span> gives it little binding, & it held only for one cast.
