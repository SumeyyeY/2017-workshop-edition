## Working in rough with <span class="m">wax</span>

 
When the <span class="m">wax</span> is too hard, one mixes in some <span class="m">turpentine</span> or a bit of <span class="m">butter</span>, which renders the <span class="m">wax</span> malleable, and cleaner than <span class="m">tallow</span>, which the <span class="pl">Italians</span> mix in, because oftentimes, it is necessary to put the tools into the mouth, <span class="sup">tools</span> which are better when made from <span class="m">box wood</span> or <span class="m">antler</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Wax</span> for molding

 
Since the <span class="m">wax</span> is molten, they have some <span class="m">sulphur</span> in a spoon or crucible and pour it in the molten <span class="m">wax</span>. And with the <span class="m">sulphur</span> going to the bottom or staying on top, it stays where it is and mixes only its substance in the <span class="m">wax</span>, and renders it more meltable when warming it, in such a way that having molded it, <span class="sup">the <span class="m">wax</span></span> gently melts in the mold like <span class="m">butter</span>, without leaving any blister or boil. Also be warned to not give it too much heat.

## Molding <span class="m">wax</span>

 
So that your mold takes hold without repelling any surface on a form or figure in <span class="m">wax</span><span class="m">,</span> it is necessary to rub the <span class="m">wax</span> with <span class="m">oil</span> and soak your sand in lukewarm <span class="m">water</span>, because cold <span class="m">water</span> repels <span class="m">oil</span> even more and will not make a good layer on the <span class="m">wax</span>.

> Rub the <span class="m">oil</span> on very very lightly, <span class="sup">use</span> so little that it hardly appears at all. Then rub with some <span class="m">spirits</span>. After soak your sand in lukewarm <span class="m">water</span> so that it does not repel the <span class="m">oil</span>.

 
  

## Forge bellows

 
It is better that at the end with the air chamber the bellows be set in some kind of bit of cloven board because they are more secure this way. Afterwards you can lightly secure them from the top. It is necessary that the nozzles be four fingers above the bottom of the forge.

 
  

## Molding <span class="al">snakes</span>

 
When you get them for molding, if it is possible, do not remove their teeth if you [think you might] want to keep them, because having had their teeth removed, it hurts their gums and mouths, and they can no longer eat. You can keep [the snakes] in a barrel full of <span class="m">bran</span> or even better of <span class="m">earth</span>, in a cool place, or in a <span class="m">glass</span> bottle. And give them some live frog or other live animal because they do not eat anything <span class="sup">that is</span> dead. Also I have noticed that
