that way one tempers it & reducing it into small balls, <span class="x">one</span> purges it of <span class="m">impurities</span> <span class="x">by</span> then putting it on to cook cleanly in a vessel of earth<span class="x">enware</span> in a furnace like those in which pots <span class="x">are made</span> and one leaves it there to the point at which pots would be fired. After one tempers it more with <span class="m">essence of sal ammoniac</span> & boiling it very strongly and emptying the murky <span class="m">water</span> & putting it in a separate vessel straight after put back the same <span class="m">water</span> over it & one boils & one puts back the murky <span class="m">water</span> again with the other. And one does this therefore until that which is there has passed away. In this way one purges & purifies & makes it a very fine & malleable <span class="x">matter</span>. After one has taken away the <span class="m">water</span> by tilting <span class="x">it</span> or with a <span class="m">sponge</span>, one takes the residue and dries it. Then moistening it with the aforementioned <span class="m">water</span> the way one did with the other <span class="m">sand</span>, one uses it in a frame or if it shrinks <span class="x">this</span> is a sign that it is not fired enough & needs to be fired more. This one is proper for molding all <span class="m">metal</span> and especially <span class="m">gold</span> & <span class="m">silver</span> and the more it is used the better it is. One should put <span class="m">alum</span> which you have cast of <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span> separately because it makes <span class="m">gold</span> sour if you cast it there.
 
 
  

## <span class="x"><span class="m">Stone alum</span></span>

 
<span class="m">Stone alum</span> must be reheated in a pot covered with a <span class="m">tile</span> over a good <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire so that the impurities which might be in it <span class="x">are</span> burned with that which does not burn. This is done either in the <span class="pro">goldsmith</span> forge surrounded by bricks or in a little oven vented to the fusion fire such that the pot stays red for a quarter of an hour. This is more to purify it than for anything else. It becomes reddish on top & the inside remains white & dries best this way.#

>   # Once your <span class="m">stone alum</span> is cooled down, crush it in a mortar, then grind it more finely on <span class="m">marble</span>. And this makes it into very fine wooly dust that gives binding to <span class="m">sand</span> without burning like all other things. <span class="x">This is</span> a beautiful invention. Crush it on the mortar to being careful to keep the grindings together because the dust flying can get down your collar or on your face which can have very grave consequences. Put a little each time in the mortar to avoid the dust flying. It is best to grind therefore with the pestle trained on the mortar rather than on the <span class="m">marble</span> where it spreads & on the mortar it gathers <span class="x">the dust</span> from all sides and renders it very fine & sweet to the touch.
 
 
  

## <span class="x"><span class="m">Clay</span></span>

 
<span class="m">Clay</span> used to surround molds, should be very fat & malleable, and should not be used for anything else except to make the contour of the molds. Therefore one should only chose that which is very fat and beat it very well & soak it moderately with <span class="m">water</span> & have it in a pit or <span class="m">earthenware</span> pot and make good holes with a stick with which one replenishes it with <span class="m">water</span> to keep it always fresh & soft and ready to use when needed.
