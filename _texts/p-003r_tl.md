## Imitation coral

 \+ 
One must first make the branches from <span class="m">wood</span> or take a fantastical <span class="m">thorn branch</span>, then melt a pound of the best possible <span class="m">clear</span> <span class="m">pine resin</span> and add one ounce of finely ground <span class="m">vermilion</span> together with <span class="m">walnut oil,</span> and if you add a little <span class="m">Venice</span> <span class="m">lake</span> the color will be all the more vivid, and stir all together into the <span class="m">resin,</span> molten over a <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire, not over an open flame, lest it catch fire. Then dip in your branches with a swirling motion. And should there remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the <span class="m">charcoal</span>.

>   <span class="m">Colophony</span> is nothing other than <span class="m">resin</span> that has been cooked again. To do it well, you take a <span class="m">leaded</span> <span class="tl">pot</span> and melt the <span class="m">resin</span>, boiling it over the brazier for a good hour until it appears not thick but clear and liquid like <span class="m">water</span> and it easily runs as a thread off the end of a stick, which you use to crush and test it. Then pour it through a coarse <span class="m">canvas</span> or <span class="m">tammy cloth</span> so that it falls into the strongest <span class="m">vinegar</span> you can find, because the <span class="m">vinegar</span> makes it strong and makes it less brittle. Repeat this two or three times and it will be fine and well purified. To imitate your <span class="m">coral</span>, you can mix a fourth part of <span class="m">mastic</span> with your purified <span class="m">resin</span> to make it more solid and finer, and if you should use just one drop of <span class="m">mastic</span>, it would be all the better, but it would take too long.

>   It is made like <span class="m">cement</span>, which is stronger when mixed with crushed <span class="m">glass</span> rather than with <span class="m">brick</span>. In the same way, together with the <span class="m">vermilion</span>, one mixes in <span class="m">opaque red enamel</span>, finely ground. It is the same way with all <span class="m">enamel</span> colors.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Varnish</span> for panels

 
Take a <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m"><span class="pl">Venice</span> turpentine</span> & heat it in a <span class="tl">pot</span> until it simmers, and put in half a <span class="ms">lb</span> of the <span class="m">turpentine oil</span> of the whitest you can find, and stir it all together well on a <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire and take it off immediately. And <span class="del">elle</span> it is done. But if it seems too thick to you, add in a little more <span class="m">oil</span>. Similarly if it is too clear, you can thicken it by putting a little <span class="m">turpentine</span>. Thus you will give it whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings and other painted things without distorting the colors or yellowing. And it dries both <span class="env">in the shade</span> and <span class="env">in the sun</span>, and <span class="tmp">overnight</span>, and <span class="tmp">during the winter</span> as well as <span class="tmp">in the summer</span>. It is usually sold 15 <span class="cn">sols</span> a <span class="ms">lb</span>.
 
> *at left bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   A little more <span class="m">turpentine</span> than <span class="m">turpentine oil</span> is needed in order to give body to the <span class="m">varnish</span>, which needs to be applied with <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span> in order to spread it thinner and less thick, for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks. One does not <span class="m">varnish</span> to make paintings shine, for it just takes the light out of them.
 
> *at bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   But it is used to enhance colors which have soaked in and to keep them from dust. <span class="m">Mastic varnish</span> does not resist <span class="env">rain</span>, whereas that of <span class="m">oil</span> and <span class="m">rosin</span> does.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Thick varnish</span> for floorboards

 
There is a <span class="m">varnish</span> that takes a long time to dry & still drips up to two <span class="tmp">months</span> after it has been applied to the floorboards. But this one does not drip like the one used <span class="tmp">in the past</span>, which was made of <span class="m">linseed oil</span> boiled with <span class="m">garlic</span>, to extinguish it & take out the fattiness, & with <span class="m">wheat</span>. And this one yellowed & made the blue color of paintings greenish. This one is made like the other one except that one puts <span class="m">common thick turpentine</span>
