Dry some <span class="m">rosemary</span> in the month of May, then fill this bowl with <span class="m">powder</span> made of it, and place a lit <span class="m">charcoal</span> on top. And, receive the smoke by a quite tightened mouth having closed your mouth well, and a part will come out by your nose. But if you want to purge the head also pinch the nose. Against colds, rheums, and other maladies.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Fatty</span> <span class="m">earth</span>

 
<span class="pro">Founders</span> use [this <span class="m">earth</span>] to make the handles of their bells. Before it [the <span class="m">earth</span>] is used, they beat it quite hard, [and] then they leave it to dry gradually in the shade & for a long time. And they mold it quite neatly. But the <span class="m">earth</span> must not be <span class="m">sand</span>y <span class="del">&</span>; rather, the <span class="m">earth</span> must be carefully selected & soft.
 
 
  

## Recipe for making <span class="m">bronze</span> and many kind of <span class="m">varnishes</span>

 
To make an excellent <span class="m">varnish</span> with <span class="m">clear</span> <span class="m">water</span> which you will use with a brush and which [the <span class="m">varnish</span>] dries immediately for applying to <span class="m">paper</span>, a little table, or any other thing
 
First, you will take five ounces of <span class="m">spirits</span> and one ounce of <span class="m">benzoin</span>. Crush them between two <span class="sup">pieces of</span> <span class="m">paper</span> or <span class="m">cards</span> or in a mortar.
