## Perspectives

 
Painting perspectives in <span class="m">oil</span> takes a long time because of the many lines that need to be drawn with a ruler, and for that reason one generally paints them in distemper. One chooses the <span class="sup">vanishing</span> points at will. The main thing is to know <span class="sup">where</span> the point is. One commonly sets two or three, sometimes <span class="sup">up to</span> five.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Ocher</span>

 
This is used for faces, hair, skulls and rocks.
 
 
  

## Distant people and animals

 
First one roughs them out in gray or in purple, which is made of <span class="m">azure</span> ash and <span class="m">lake</span>. Once dry, one highlights and finishes with flesh tones and other colors and white. And it will look better and is quicker to do than in black and white. Armies are painted the same way.
 
 
  

## Drawing

 
After you have primed your panel and scraped it with a knife to make it quite even, you will start drawing with the longest possible piece of <span class="m">charcoal</span>, because with a short one you would not see your line so well and you would make it rougher. Let the tip of the <span class="m">charcoal</span> be sharp, and to prevent if from quickly becoming dulled and blunt, drag the tip flat, thus you will constantly sharpen it. Hold your <span class="m">charcoal</span> as far as possible, and accustom yourself to drawing with a light touch. Because if you become accustomed to drawing delicately with <span class="m">charcoal</span>, you shall do the same with colors. And whoever is rough with <span class="m">charcoal</span> is never exquisite with colors. And by a line of <span class="m">charcoal</span>, masters assess their apprentices. First make the contour of your drawing, that is the outline, lightly and without too diligent work, rather with boldness. By so doing, you will learn to be an artist, and if you need to to erase anything, you will not waste as much time as if you had elaborated it. Afterwards work on all the details, not standing too close to your panel, but sometimes stepping back in order to better assess the proportions. Once you are satisfied with the first drawing, retrace all the lines with your paintbrush in pink or another <span class="m">gummed</span> or <span class="m">distempered color</span>. Thus you will work more surely with colors, and with less trouble.
