## <span class="m">Sal ammoniac</span> and <span class="m">iron dross</span>

 
I pulverized <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, <span class="sup">previously</span> well dried in a <span class="m">hot bronze</span> mortar over <span class="m">heat</span>. Then I filtered the <span class="m">salt</span> through a double sieve; it became very fine. But to make it finer, I dry ground it on the <span class="m">porphyry</span>, then I mixed it with <span class="m">iron dross</span> which was pulverized & ground the same way. Both ingredients take a very clean cast of basâ€”reliefs, without being moistened with serain, or into the hollow mould, or anywhere else with the serviette, & the cast can be cleanly removed. 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
<span class="pro">Molders</span> from <span class="pl">Foix</span> who cast their medals sideways use <span class="m">crocum ferri</span> and <span class="m">calcinated</span> <span class="m">slate</span>. It is used for very flat things.
 
 
  

## Every kind of sand can be made useful

 
<span class="pro">Artisans</span> who do big works, & who need to search for things made by nature to pursue their work, because nature does not want to sell its wares to its children, and in order to save the time they would spend grinding, pulverizing & artificially preparing their sand, look for sand from sandpits, which is not too fat from the <span class="m">soil</span>, nor too arid &, consequently, without any binder effect. From deep in the sandpit, one can find some lumps & gravel that show the sand's natural compaction; it is quite hard to break & with very small & fine grains & quite smooth between the fingers. And since it is found solely close to mountainous regions & arid lands, you cannot find any near every good town, where <span class="pro">artisans</span> live. Thus, if they can't find any close to their home, they prefer to order some of this sand from afar, like Lyon, Venice or Paris, near the Sainte Chapelle, & similar areas, instead of preparing it themselves. Nonetheless, you can be assured that in all locations, you can make sand from the sandpit
