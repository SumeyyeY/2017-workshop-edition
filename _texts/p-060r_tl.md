and to prevent it from breaking, mix in a little <span class="m">oil</span> and melt them together and fill the cracks and make them even and paint on them. And the <span class="m">oil</span> mixed with <span class="m">wax</span> will help colors to hold since they are also distempered with <span class="m">oil</span>.

 
  

## First whitening of the painting

 
Apply two or three layers of <span class="m">chalk</span> distempered with <span class="m">glue</span> on the painting, not with a paintbrush but with a <span class="sup">large</span> brush as if you intended to rub it down, and leave to dry. And repeat this two or three times, then make the last layer quite even using a knife, <span class="add">then apply a layer of <span class="m">glue</span></span> upon which you will later be able to put your underlayer and then paint. But make sure that your first white layer is not too thick for it would break easily. Flemish painters have such paintings made by the dozen.

 
  

## Working neatly

 
When you are at work make sure you do raise no dust, and when you leave your work cover it so that the said dust will not fall upon it. Also apply your colors as thinly as possible, for if they are thick you will be unable to soften them.

>   Do not apply color on color if they are not similar, such as white on black, but rather flesh over flesh, and so on. And leave empty spaces for shadows or different colors. By doing so, laying each sort of color directly on the underlayer, they will not fade and your work will be neat.

 
  

## <span class="m">Oil</span>

 
<span class="m"><span class="pa">Walnut</span> oil</span> extracted like<span class="m">peeled <span class="pa">almonds</span></span> is very white. This one of <span class="m">Palma christi</span>. And when the <span class="m">oil</span> has had a little body, the colors soften. For if the <span class="m">oil</span> is too clear, the colors run & do not bind, even those that do not have body. <span class="m">Fatty oil</span> that is not easily imbibed is appropriate for <span class="m">varnish</span>. The <span class="m">oil</span> is desiccative enough when it dries out as quickly as <span class="m">common varnish</span>. <span class="m">Oils</span> do not dry as quickly in cold countries as in hot countries. <span class="m">Oil</span> <span class="env">exposed to the sun</span> is clarified well. But it fattens. If you put in <span class="m">ceruse</span> or <span class="m">lead filings</span> or <span class="m">lead white</span> or <span class="m">calcined pulverized <span class="del">p</span>glass</span>. To avoid this, put the <span class="tl">vial</span> in <span class="m">clear water</span>.
 
Colors in <span class="m">oil</span>, once dry, sometimes do not easily receive the second colors, to prevent this, breathe on them & the color will take.
