The <span class="m">sand</span> near my area is very excellent. But one ought to, in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been used. For it dries out after having been cast several times & is lean & has no body. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any thickness, it is necessary that your substance of <span class="m">copper</span> be very hot so that it penetrates & runs. Some mix in <span class="m">lead</span> with the fonte, but it is for large works & not for small ones.
 
<span class="m">Sand from oxen feet</span> twice—burned and finely ground melts more neatly with <span class="m">copper</span>, & without a chappe, than <span class="m">sand</span> that I have seen. I have cast a high relief medal with it, and <span class="del">f</span> with a thickness as delicate as a knife blade or a card. And being a hollow on one side, opposite the relief which was on other side.
 
It is necessary that lean <span class="m">sands</span> be more moistened than others, namely with <span class="m">magistra</span> or good pure <span class="m">wine</span> or <span class="m">boiled wine with elm tree roots</span> & similar things. But very fine <span class="m">sands</span>, like <span class="m">burned linen</span> which is fat and soft on its own, want to be applied dry.
 
All moistened <span class="m">sand</span> wants to be very beaten & sitrred in order to be ground finely \& to flatten out the clods that it makes in itself when it is bathed.
 
The <span class="m">olive oil</span> that some mix in with beaten <span class="m">egg white</span> makes it become porous.
 
<span class="m">Sand of calcined glass</span> withstands several castings, but there are only the first ones. It also becomes porous.
 
<span class="m">Latten</span> comes out on its own, but it runs too quickly. It is good to mix it with a little <span class="m">copper</span>, like a quarter part, with <span class="m">the substance of skillets.</span>.
 
<span class="pro">Founders</span> cast well box molds up to 30 or 40 <span class="ms">lb</span>, but not more.

>   It is good for big work, but for small ones it is troublesome for releasing. <span class="del">Il</span> because it crumbles. It is good that it be alloyed with some fat thing which has bond such as molded <span class="m">tripoly</span> or <span class="del">ab</span> burned <span class="m">felt</span> or <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> or <span class="m">tripoly</span> & similar things.
