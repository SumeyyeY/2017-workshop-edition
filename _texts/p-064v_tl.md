## Apprenticeship of the <span class="pro">painter</span>

 
First, one gives him an <span class="m">egg</span> to do in which one has him make half a face, then a whole one with the ears, next the neck, then the parts of the body separately, next joined, then one figure, then two & three, finally a history, teaching him how to hold the <span class="m">charcoal</span> by the end, & also the pinceau. Once he knows how to draw, one teaches him how to layer colors.
 
 
  

## One also presents him with these strokes & lines

 
The figure of the <span class="m">egg</span> is the main pattern for faces <span class="add">and for bent bodies</span>, as the cross is the model for a full, straight figure. Without these strokes you will never do anything well.

## Softening

 
To soften well, you must not lay the colors thick, but rather lay them twice, except for <span class="m">azure enamel</span>.

>   All colors that lack body in <span class="m">oil</span> also lack body in distemper. In distemper they even sink to the bottom. <span class="m">Distempered colors</span> need to be fat, which you can tell when they stick to the palette after being distempered in <span class="m">oil</span>.
 
 
  

## Straight lines

 
You can use the ruler, but do not lay it flat on the painting, but somewhat lifted and resting on the edges of the panel. Otherwise you would smudge everything, and also you would not see the strokes well.
 
 
  

## Distemper

 
It is necessary that <span class="m">distempered colors</span> are kept darker while you distemper them, because they become lighter when they dry. But <span class="m">oil colors</span> remain the same colors.
