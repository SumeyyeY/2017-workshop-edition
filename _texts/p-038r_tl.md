## <span class="m">Sapphire</span>

 
There are <span class="m">sapphires</span> that one calls trellis <span class="sup">sapphires</span>, for they are pierced and it is said that a certain king had a certain ornament in the shape of a trellis made out of these, as perhaps the Screen of Charlemagne, as it is named, would be, in the treasure of <span class="pl">Saint Denis</span>, in which the gemstones are set without foil, so as to enjoy their luminosity from both sides, & to show their vividness. I have a white one that seems to be rough & pierced, and is all over spotted with blue blemishes; I am of the opinion that these are artificial & made of <span class="m">taffre</span> or very clear azure <span class="m">enamel</span> fused on the <span class="m">sapphire</span>. <span class="add">A <span class="tl">file</span> bites into it as it does with <span class="m">beryl</span>.</span>
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="pa">Saffron</span></span>

 
It is imitated & cut with half dried <span class="pa">marigold</span> leaves, & twisted like a thread, & placed in the hottest sun to dry, & is mixed, & the aforesaid <span class="pa">marigold</span> even gives some color.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sapphire</span>

 
<span class="pro">Stone cutters</span> sometimes choose old pieces of antique <span class="m">glass</span> in church windows, which are much thicker than those of today & are of more vivid colors. If it is for <span class="del">souf</span> <span class="m">sapphire</span>, they choose beautiful blue & from such a place that there are no <span class="del">pieces</span> grains, if it is possible. And having cut it into squares with <span class="m">emery</span>, they cut it in bevel & polish it. In this manner, they imitate very beautiful <span class="m">sapphires</span>. The old azure <span class="m">enamel</span> for <span class="m">silver</span>, verging on aquamarine, was very suitable for imitating <span class="m">sapphires</span>, but it is scarcely found. <span class="m">Aquamarines</span> are imitated with white <span class="m">glass</span>, but they take it from the bottom of the glass.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Amber</span>

 
The orange color of transparent <span class="m">amber</span>, and of the other one which has body, is not internal, for it is whitish on the inside. But it acquires this reddish crust with age or through the wearing of it. This is why those who cut it with a file or on the wheel do not remove this crust if it is possible. But rather they only polish it, rubbing it with a <span class="m">willow</span> stick or other soft wood dipped into <span class="m">water</span> & dusted with <span class="pl">Brittany</span> <span class="m">tripoli</span>, and it takes a beautiful polish. If it is too straw yellow, & you want to intensify its color, hang it inside a chimney where there is much <span class="m">soot</span> & smoke, and it will take on a reddish—orange color. Try to take the most whitish transparent one, and put it under <span class="m">manure</span> to turn it green, as with bones. Or smoke it in a closed space, in <span class="m">safre</span> or <span class="m">manganese</span> smoke & other drugs that you know of. Or in <span class="m">urine</span> and <span class="m">distilled vinegar</span> mixed with colors, or in the vapor of <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> boiling in <span class="m">copper</span>, or <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> boiling with <span class="m">silver</span> & <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>; & some cut facets in the <span class="m">amber</span> on a wheel of <span class="m">soft wood</span> with <span class="m">putty</span> instead of <span class="m">emery</span>, & <span class="m">jet</span> also. The salt called de Langlois de armonic is a mineral salt that resembles <span class="m">marble</span> stone and is a very hard mineral with large pieces, like that of <span class="pl">Cardona</span> and <span class="pl">Monserrat</span>.

>   I have experienced that it turns reddish on the surface when boiled in <span class="m">lye</span> or <span class="m">corrosive water</span>. And if it is scrubbed with <span class="m">fir</span> and <span class="m">soft wood</span> before cooling down, it is easily cut.
