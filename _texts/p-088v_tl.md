## <span class="m">Sand</span> from pulverised <span class="m">rock salt</span> and <span class="m">sand</span> from a <span class="m">minium</span> finely ground on <span class="m">marble</span> 

 
After they have been dryly ground & beaten in the mortar, they are ground finely on the <span class="m">marble</span>. I mixed the same quantity of each material, and in order to mix them better, I ground them on the <span class="m">porphyry</span> again, & then filtered this through a double sieve or the sleeve of a <span class="m">shirt</span>. Then, I put them on sheets of <span class="m">paper</span> & stored it on <span class="m">marble</span> in a cellar. In one night, they were both moist enough [that there there was no need] to dampen them further because <span class="m">rock salt</span>, like all other salts, dissolves in dampness. I molded with this very neatly because both should be quite fine. They need to be moist enough so it can be removed easily.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Mineral sand</span>

 
It does not matter if the <span class="sup">sand</span> color is white or yellow. Above all it <span class="sup">the sand</span> must be lumped <span class="sup">together</span> & much like a precious stone or a stone, & the deeper <span class="sup">in the earth</span> one gets it from, the better. The signs of its quality is that it is thus gathered together, that, if the <span class="m">stone</span> is removed as it should be <span class="sup">i.e. in the correct way</span>, it forms pieces & <span class="del"></span> lumps <span class="sup">together</span>, which demonstrates its <span class="sup">capacity for</span> binding, & that it <span class="sup">the sand</span> is not too dry.
 
However, it should crumble in your hands. & the grain must be <span class="del"></span> quite small & fine, & homogeneous. If this <span class="sup">sand</span> is not fine enough, you can filter it & grind it up finely either with <span class="m">water</span>, or through a sieve, <span class="del">& when it</span> or on the <span class="m">porphyry</span>. & That way it loses its dryness and becomes greasy & well bound. You can mold it in <span class="del"></span> a box mold or in a noyau without wadding, & try it with <span class="m">lead</span> because, if it does not swell & casts neatly, it will bear out well too. Some say that fatty <span class="m">sands</span> do not work for casting <span class="m">metal</span> that is too hot. <span class="pro">Artisans</span> who undertake a big job & who want to save money do not need to crush <span class="sup">sand</span> & seek the curious <span class="sup">properties</span> of <span class="m">artificial sand</span>; they have more to profit from finding natural sand that has the finest grain possible. & for a small job, they take advantage of finding the finest natural sand they can. For a smaller job, they only filter the sand through the sieve. But those who work on a very small scale crush the <span class="m">sand</span> & grind it finely <span class="sup">until it becomes</span> impalpable, because they do not need as much <span class="sup">sand</span>.

>   Ground <span class="m">wheat</span> makes a tawny—colored powder <span class="sup">that is</span> quite fine & quite soft. Once this powder has been mixed, it can <span class="del">mix</span> mold very neatly. Try <span class="m">wheat flour</span> burned in an enclosed fire.
