## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
<span class="m">Brick</span> alone, quite finely sifted, & rubbed together, is good for casting <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">copper</span>, when diluted with <span class="m">urine</span>. This <span class="m">whitish brick</span> should be used.
 
 
  

## Make <span class="m">copper</span> and <span class="m">latten</span> flow

 
At the end of the casting, as it is very hot, add some <span class="m">salt ammicke</span> & <span class="m">saltpetre</span>, it is a way to remove <span class="m">grime</span>. Mix some <span class="m">clay</span> with the <span class="m">latten</span>. The <span class="m">metal</span> must not touch the <span class="m">iron</span> or the <span class="m">latten</span> of the frame, but covered with <span class="m">sand</span> or <span class="m">luth</span>, it makes a very homogeneous cast.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
Calcined <span class="m">black pebbles from the river</span> are good [to use] for <span class="m">lead</span>. But they are weakened if used with <span class="m">metal</span>.
 
There is only <span class="m">ardille clay</span> with which one can make <span class="m">tiles</span>, recooked & reddened & passed through a <span class="m">long narrow bag</span> carefully soaked with <span class="m">raw egg white</span>.
 
<span class="m">Willow charcoal</span> is excellent with <span class="m">sand</span> [and] <span class="m">lead</span>.
 
<span class="m">Latten</span> flows better.
 
 
  

## Cast of the frame

 
It is good to make it with <span class="m">bow wood</span>. Turn it in order to make it homogeneous, as that is important for the casting. Cover the mouth of the frame with <span class="m">clay</span> or <span class="m">sand</span>, so that the <span class="m">molten</span> <span class="m">metal</span>, <span class="m">copper</span> or <span class="m">lead</span>, do not touch at all the <span class="m">iron</span> or <span class="m">latten</span> of the frame, because it would turn it sour, & make it filled with bubbles. Always cast higher than the mold. Pay attention that the cast is not too wide or too deep because the narrowest is the best one. Because when it is large, the weight of the matter which runs breaks & spreads the mold & fills the matter with bubbles. When you have casted, gently hit your frame, so that the matter spreads better. <span class="m">Black lead [de saulmon]</span> of the first melting, works very neatly.
