*[continued]*
 
Molds for fine things, like <span class="m">wormwood</span> or something similar, can only be used once, dip the molds into <span class="m">water</span> before breaking them. Things twice reheated are dissolve easily into <span class="m">water</span>. If you don't do that your work will be hard to be stripped of the mold without being spoiled.
 
Good <span class="m">stone alum</span> is white and as shiny as white silk, this <span class="m">stone alum</span> is made of long pieces, as long as a finger, and is very fragile and woolly and fluffy. <span class="m">Stone alum</span> made of <span class="m">stone</span> is harder and not so good. The best quality can be found in France near Ronan. For our <span class="m">sand</span>, <span class="m">stone alum</span> must be crushed into a mortar, and must be ground on the <span class="m">marble</span> again. Don't even think about sieving it because this matter is fat and woolly, it wouldn't pass through any sieve because of the very fine and soft filaments. These filaments give the <span class="m">sand</span> a much greater binding effect than natural <span class="m">wool</span> or even the <span class="m">filler</span> the <span class="pro">foundry owner</span> uses for big works, because natural <span class="m">wool</span> and <span class="m">filler</span> burn and <span class="m">stone feather alum</span> resists fire.
 
When you cast surround the <span class="m">sand</span> of your mold with very beaten greasy <span class="m">earth</span>. Make a circle around your mold with this <span class="m">earth</span>.
 
Archanum omnibus fere reconditum est in re fusoria,<br/> v{idelicet} res exprimenda formis, sive <span class="m">herba</span> sit sive <span class="m">animal</span><br/> ut <span class="m">lucerta</span>, inmergatur primum in <span class="m">vini spiritum</span><br/> aprime rectificatum, deinde pulvere composito aspergatur<br/> sive illinatur (si pulvis in formam pultis redactus sit, ut<br/> assolet)
 
When you want to mold something hollow, the core must be made of the same matter, if the snake or the animal is curved or folded you must do your core in several pieces.
 
Try [to see] if distilled <span class="m">vinegar</span> is good for eating away, it will dissolve the <span class="m">animal</span> inside the hollow mold.

>   If you know that your <span class="m">plaster</span> cannot endure fire without breaking, do not take the recipe of the mixture literally, sometimes you can add less <span class="m">stone alum</span> than above. Because <span class="m">stone alum</span> soften molds. Once reheated do not grind the <span class="m">stone alum</span> again, leave it ground as the <span class="pro">apothecaries</span> did. It will not prevent the cast from being neat, and will give more binder to your cast. When the mold holds the color of the brick and is reddened then it will be harder.
