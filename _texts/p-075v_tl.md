## Making grey <span class="m">wood</span>

 
It is necessary to take three demi—sestiers of <span class="m">iron</span> filings per 18 <span class="del"></span> deniers of <span class="m">rock alum</span>, and for as much <span class="sup">18 deniers</span> <span class="m">green copperas</span> for six deniers of <span class="m">verdigris</span>, <span class="del"></span> pitch and a quart of <span class="del"></span><span class="m">currier water</span>; and if you can't find any, use <span class="del"></span><span class="m">rainwater</span> [blank] of a slight degree. 
 
 
  

## Gilding <span class="m">wood</span>

 
First of all it is necessary to apply a coat of very clear <span class="m">glue</span>; and when it is dry, you will apply a coat of <span class="m">yellow gold</span>; and when this is done you will take <span class="m">fig tree wood</span> and soak it for a while, and wash the place you want to gild, and cut your <span class="m">gold</span> with a knife near where you will put it; and said <span class="m">gold</span> must be applied with <span class="m">cotton</span><span class="del"></span>, and if you can find some <span class="m">fig tree</span>, take an <span class="m">egg white</span> and stir it frequently.
 
 If your <span class="m">gold</span> does not have a nice enough color, you will take a <span class="m">partridge feather</span> burn it in a chafing—dish, and turn the smoke toward what you have gilded.
 
 
  

## Gilding with ground <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Take a <span class="ms">coquille</span> of <span class="m">gold</span>, soak it with gum water before you intend to work, and then apply it with a brush, and polish it with a <span class="del"></span><span class="m">wolf's tooth</span> once it is dry.
 
 
  

## Recipe for coloring all <span class="m">wood</span>

 
To make it black, the wood needs to be soaked in <span class="m">olive oil</span> and tough <span class="m">meat</span> in a similar case for four or five days, then boil it in where the wood has soaked for one hour, then take it <span class="sup">the wood</span> out of the oil. Take some <span class="m">natural sulphur</span> if possible otherwise take another
