## For making gray <span class="m">wood</span>

 
One needs to take three half <span class="ms">setiers</span> of <span class="m">iron</span> filings for 18 deniers of <span class="m">alung de glace</span>, & for as much <span class="m">green copperas</span>, for six deniers of <span class="m">verdigris</span>, pitch, & a quart of <span class="m"><span class="pro">currier</span> water</span>, and if you cannot find it, you will put <span class="m">rainwater</span>  of slight degree. 
 
 
  

## For gilding on <span class="m">wood</span>

 
First one needs to lay down a coat of <span class="m">glue</span> very clear, and once dry, you will lay down a coat of <span class="m">yellow gold</span>. And when it is done, you will take <span class="m">fig tree wood</span>, & put it to soak some space of time, & wash the places you want to gild, and cut your <span class="m">gold</span> with a knife to the price that you will lay down. And one must lay down the said <span class="m">gold</span> with <span class="m">cotton</span>. And if you can find <span class="m">fig tree</span>, take the <span class="m">the white of one egg</span> & stir it vigorously.
 
 If your <span class="m">gold</span> does not have beautiful enough color, you will take a <span class="m">partridge feather</span>, & make it burn it in a chafingâ€”dish, and make the smoke go against what you have gilded.
 
 
  

## For gilding of ground <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Take a <span class="ms">coquille</span> of <span class="m">gold</span>, soak it with gum water before you intend to work, and then apply it with a brush, and polish it with a <span class="del"></span><span class="m">wolf's tooth</span> once it is dry.
 
 
  

## Recipe for coloring all <span class="m">wood</span>

 
To make it black, the wood needs to be soaked in <span class="m">olive oil</span> and tough <span class="m">meat</span> in a similar case for four or five days, then boil it in where the wood has soaked for one hour, then take it <span class="sup">the wood</span> out of the oil. Take some <span class="m">natural sulphur</span> if possible otherwise take another
