## Quince trees

 
They have to be pruned often; otherwise they die and do not produce good fruit.
 
 
  

## Cannons

 
They are very difficult to drill when they are made of <span class="m">metal</span> since the material is rough and brittle. But you must not push the drill too strongly or push all at once, but remove it often. In that case, the cannon mouth is bigger than the bullet in order to avoid drilling, since the material can be easily cast and slides. The drill should not be like a dovetail, or a point, but should be cut in round like a crankshaft. If it breaks, don't leave it to rust X

## Bells

 
They are not made in a pit if they do not fit
 
 
  

## To gilt frames paintings without <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Some use some leaved <span class="m">orpiment</span> and then powder it and make the leaves look Moorish, burnish them, and the <span class="m">orpiment</span> shines like gold. However, ground metals or ground crystalline or touchstone are the best.
 
 
  

## Orange Orpiment

 
Mix it with <span class="m">arsenic</span> and grind it. Some prefer to melt it and then add a little <span class="m">arsenic</span>.
 
 
  

## Varnish

 
Some make the <span class="m">mastic varnish</span> with two ounces of <span class="m">mastic</span> and one of clear, white <span class="m">turpentine oil</span> and some <span class="m">spirits</span> as aforesaid; heat that on <span class="m">ashes</span> until it melts and then leave it still and put it in another vessel to remove dust.
