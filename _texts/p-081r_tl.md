## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
Some excellent [sand] is found for use with <span class="m">lead</span>, <span class="m">tin</span> & <span class="m">copper</span> close to the hill of <span class="pl">Pech—David</span>, close to <span class="pl">Toulouse</span>. It should not be reheated much because drying out suddenly, it will lose its binding [properties] & retract [?] at the first inflow of <span class="m">metal</span>, which makes the work become rough & unclean. It is much better to reheat it from a distance, instead of with a <span class="m">straw flame</span>, which generates <span class="del"></span> <span class="m">grime</span>. Instead of filling the frame, you can use finer <span class="m">sand</span> which you will have in a very <span class="m">thin cloth</span>, & polish the medal and then the <span class="m">wet</span> <span class="m">sand</span> that you will put over it<span class="m">,</span> which has more body<span class="m">,</span> will grip it.

## <span class="m">Earth</span> for moulding

 
<span class="m"><span class="pro">Sheath maker</span>'s earth</span> or the one <span class="pro"><span class="m">potters</span></span> use to blanche the pots to make the <span class="m">lead</span> flow better on it & to prevent the <span class="m">lead</span> from soaking into them is very good to cast the hollow parts of what you want in relief. It releases better than <span class="m">plaster</span> or <span class="m">sulphur</span> which become hard once they have grasped on [to the mould] because <span class="m">earth</span> sticks. It needs to be beaten vigorously so that it does not break. If the piece you want to mould is very large you can mould different parts separately. If you reheat it, it must be over a <span class="m">closed fire</span>. One finds this <span class="m">earth</span> at <span class="pl">Le Fousseret</span>, & in another place called <span class="pl">Ox</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Plaster</span>

 
It needs to be well cooked, which you will recognize when cooking it in an <span class="m">iron</span> or <span class="m">metal</span> casket. Mix it with an <span class="m">iron</span> rod & if it sticks to the <span class="m">iron</span>, it is not cooked enough, and if it doesn't then it is ready. The <span class="m">water</span> with which you soak it has to be a little warm & the mould of the above mentioned <span class="m">earth</span> or other, also should be a little hot. The <span class="m">plaster</span> work does not last & the faces & delicate things break if one does not use <span class="m">glue</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Carton</span>

 
It is necessary to take <span class="m">paper</span> from Florence, which is the finest, & crush it & soak it several times & change the <span class="m">water</span> every day, that way it does not smell bad. & after having moulded it into the hollow, put a <span class="m">cloth</span> over it, & from the back side, rub the back of your <span class="m">paper</span> with a sharp piece, as if you wanted to polish it and it will mould very neat. Then <span class="m">glue</span> some cloth from the back side with strong <span class="m">glue</span>.
