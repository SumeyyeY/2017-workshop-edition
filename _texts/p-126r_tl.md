## Molding fruits and animals in sugar

 
<span class="m">Sugar</span> is fatty, and, with it, round things and large muscles are cast well but fine and delicate things [are cast with] difficulty. However, try well—purified <span class="m">sugar</span>. The <span class="m">plaster</span> mold must be soaked in <span class="m">water</span> for a full night or a full day before casting <span class="m">sugar</span> so that it [the mold] is saturated with <span class="m">water</span> and does not soak up the <span class="m">syrup</span> [the <span class="m">sugar</span> mixture]. The [plaster] mold must also be stripped very well from it [the sugar], because <span class="m">sugar</span> is aigre and brittle. Thus, do not cast anything with <span class="m">sugar</span> which is not stripped easily from it, and which can not be neatly molded in two parts to open as will be needed. If you want to mold a grape, you must get it when it is very fresh; because if it is withered, it [the cast] will look the same. See to it, thus, that you make your molds in the natural season for each thing [fruit]. Grapes that one wants to cast in <span class="m">sugar</span> are man—made, either with <span class="m">wax</span> or <span class="m">earth</span> or with grapes molded with melted <span class="m">wax</span>, on some dish [plaste & chose pleine] in a way so that they are pressed closely together and easily stripped from it. And only a half [of the grapes] should be molded. Or, if you have some of those grapes called chauches or sauvignons which have well—pressed grapes, set half of the grapes in the dish of <span class="m">clay</span>, and cast on the other half, and if any grape is not stripped from it, pluck it out. Note that a grape whose grapes are set apart and separated cannot mold well in either <span class="m">sugar</span> or <span class="m">metal</span> because the ends of the cluster are so fine. Similarly, if the grape is kept, that it cannot hold the bunched grapes. Therefore, a hollow should be cast, which you will not be capable of if the grape is not close together and without having them spread apart.

Rather, fill half of the mold, and then join the two [halves], and keep turning [it] until the <span class="m">sugar</span> is solidified and cold. Do not mix anything in the mold except the reheated <span class="m">plaster</span>, as you know.

>   The sign that the <span class="m">syrup</span> or the melted <span class="m">sugar</span> has boiled enough in the <span class="m">water</span> for casting fruits is when it makes threads when shaking it. And if it passes this point, it will not be good because it will make [it] damp. If the <span class="m">sugar</span> corrodes itself, throw a bit of <span class="m">amidin</span> in the mold or rub it with an <span class="m">almond</span>.
