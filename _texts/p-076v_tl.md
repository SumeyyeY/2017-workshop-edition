## To make a very beautiful and inexpensive golden color

 
First of all take a very yellow <span class="m">orange peel</span> and carefully remove the white parts, and pulverize it very well <span class="del"></span> it in a very clean mortar. Take the same amount of <span class="m">sulphur</span>, grind all the ingredients together, pour the mixture into a glass vial, and store it in a cellar or other damp place for eight or ten days. When you want to apply it, the mixture needs to be warmed and applied wherever you like, and you will see a very beautiful color. 
 
 
  

## Making black gommiche

 
 Take some <span class="m">glue</span> and dilute it with <span class="m">vinegar</span> and melt it until it is very clear. Take <span class="m">lampblack</span> or another black, and dilute them together. Then apply the mixture over <span class="m">wood</span>.
 
 
  

## For white <span class="sup">gommiche</span>

 
Take white wax and ceruse, melt them together and apply the mixture to wood or to anything else.
 
 
  

## Gilding iron or tin

 
First it is necessary to wash whatever one wants to gild in wine lees, and then wash it once again with white wine. Take three ounces of terra merita and one choppine of white wine. Boil the matter for half an hour, and apply your colors over your iron or tin, or whatever else. Then leave to dry on a sheet of paper and do not put your hand in your materials.
