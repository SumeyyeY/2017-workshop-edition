and will be good & will mold cleanly. Because the <span class="m">sand</span> is coarse and dry, filter it through a sieve. If it is not fine enough, wash it. & when the <span class="m">water</span> has settled a little, pour the <span class="m">soiled</span> <span class="m">water</span> into another pot. The <span class="m">coarse [grains</span>] will quickly fall to the bottom of the first pot. But the <span class="m">sand</span> from the <span class="m">troubled water</span> pot, having settled, will be much finer. If this <span class="m">sand</span> does not bind enough, dry crush it on the <span class="m">porphyry</span>, & thus making it impalpable, & it will bind as chalk does. If you wish you can reheat it, & straight after crush it & blend it with <span class="m">salts,</span> or <span class="m">burned cloth,</span> or <span class="m">felt</span>, or <span class="m">paper ashes</span>, & similar material.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="pro">Potter</span>s' clay</span>

 
Grind it in a <span class="del">mortar</span> mustard mill with <span class="m">water</span>, <span class="sup">&</span> it will become as impalpable as possible. Dry it, & then moisten it with <span class="m">salt water</span>, which give force to <span class="del"></span> all sands in order to allow several castings.
 
 
  

## Orange trees

 
In Italy, <span class="sup">particularly</span> in the coldest areas like Lombardia, people plant the orange trees inside squared <span class="m">wood</span> planters. The planters are larger at the bottom than at the top. People make handles on each side, where they attach straps in order to carry the planter, like one carries the gout sufferers, because if one used wheels to roll them one would damage the garden's paths. Every two year they remember to open the sides of the planters and meticulously cut & trim the ends of the orange tree's roots, which are dry. Otherwise, the roots find the <span class="m">wood</span> [of the planter], tighten on it & they double over themselves & the ends dry & the tree dies. Once trimmed, the roots gain new space <span class="del"></span> to expand, without encountering resistance from the <span class="m">wood</span> <span class="sup">of the planter</span>. That is why it is better to join the sides of the planter with screws & not with nails, to avoid shaking the <span class="m">soil</span> when one opens them.
