## <span class="m">Ammonia salt</span> and <span class="m">alabaster</span>

 
Dry <span class="m">ammonia salt</span>, ground <span class="del"></span> on a <span class="m">marble</span> slab, molds very cleanly & is easily removed from the mold. & When mixed with pulverized <span class="m">alabaster</span>, use two ounces per pound of <span class="m">alabaster</span>; it also is easily removed from the mold. It should be humidified in a cellar or in the cool humid <span class="m">evening air</span>, or to have it quickly, in a sheet of <span class="m">paper</span> in a moist <span class="m">towel</span>. Take care not to leave it too long because it will soften, which would not be good if you wanted to use it as a box mold. However you can use it well as a core provided that you dry it gently & away from the fire. Otherwise the heat would make it swell, & push the <span class="m">salt</span> onto the surface, causing lumps. If you want to mold a core, <span class="del"></span> rub your medal with <span class="m">aspic oil</span>. It is better to use 4 ounces of <span class="m">ammonia salt</span> per pound. Humidify it in a damp place for two or three days, so that the material can be handled without sticking. You will mold very cleanly. Let the mold dry out & reheat it, that way it will get body, and become as hard as stone & when it is like that it is far easier to remove from the mold. If you do not reheat it, it could crumble when removed from the mold because of its thinness. It is the same with a large relief medal. Once you have molded, pulverize the material like before, and moisten it in a damp atmosphere.

>   All <span class="m">sands</span> which can be removed easily from the mold have body, well—made fat <span class="m">ammonia</span>, and <span class="del"></span> <span class="sup">is sand</span> that removes easily from a mold. There is nothing better for binding than the <span class="m">salt of the metal</span> itself. When ground into powder, they pick up moisture, & dry & reheat together.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">White <span class="pro">glassmaker</span>'s sand</span> mixed with <span class="m">ammonia salt</span>

 
You can find this <span class="m">sand</span> in <span class="pl">Cominge</span>, near the town <span class="pl">Aurignac</span>. This sand is dry and as white <span class="del"></span> as salt. <span class="pro">Glassmakers</span> & <span class="pro">potters</span> use this sand ground on the <span class="m">porphyry</span> & it becomes as fine as possible. Easy to grind, this sand looks like <span class="m">calcined alabaster</span>, and provides a very clean mold. I have not found another as suitable for delicate bas reliefs. It is also excellent to mold as a core, without any box mold. You must grind it very finely on a <span class="m">porphyry</span> with <span class="m">gummed water</span> or <span class="m">pure water</span>, then apply a thick coat (as thick as mustard or a little bit thicker) over the medal, which has already been lightly rubbed with <span class="m">oil</span>, <span class="m">walnut oil</span> or, even better, <span class="m">aspic oil</span>. For best results,<span class="del"></span> let it dry by itself, away from fire, for one or two days. If you are in a hurry, you can heat it & it should not break if the coat is quite thick. If it is suddenly exposed to fire, some holes will appear; that does not happen if it has been gently dried. Once dry, reheat it, & it should allow for several castings.
