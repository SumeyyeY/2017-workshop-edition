## A way to mold <span class="pa">flower</span>s and <span class="pa">herb</span>s

 
It is necessary to pick them in full bloom and color, and only pick them, if it is possible, when you are ready to mold them so that they will not wilt. Or if you need to carry them from afar, put their stems in a bottle of <span class="m">water</span>, or even better in <span class="m">wine</span>. Start with making a <span class="m">wax</span> stick pointed like a big peg, of a size adapted to what you want to cast, as you see in the margin, marked A. At the bottom of this peg, put and prick a bit of <span class="m">iron</span> wire, rather thick and strong. And at the pointed end of the big peg, you will fit your <span class="pa">flower</span> stem or your <span class="pa">herb</span>. This done, set it aside. Arrange your <span class="m">clay</span> circle and outline as you did for the <span class="al">snake</span>s, in the shape of a <span class="mu">mandore</span> according to the size of your <span class="pa">herb</span>. Then take the <span class="pa">herb</span> you have prepared to be cast, as we have taught you, and wet and moisten it daintily with good <span class="m">spirits</span> with a <span class="tl">brush</span>. Then place the wire end through through the end of the <span class="m">earthen</span> mold, shaped like a <span class="mu">mandore</span>, so that the <span class="m">wax</span> peg, where the <span class="pa">herb</span> is, touches the edge of the <span class="m">earthen</span> <span class="mu">mandore</span>. And arrange your <span class="pa">herb</span> that lies thusly so that it remains in the middle of said <span class="mu">mandore</span>—shaped mold, without touching any of the side. So that the sand that you put in the mold will be of equal thickness everywhere, and will be two <span class="ms">finger</span>s higher than your <span class="pa">flower</span>. And having made sure that the wire is secure, quickly throw your <span class="m">wet sand</span> that will be much clearer than the one used for serpents, in the <span class="mu">mandore</span>—shaped mold, and the quicker the better, so that your <span class="m">spirits</span> do not evaporate. And adjust your mixture with a bit of <span class="m">essence of sal ammoniac</span>, unlike the one for serpents. And when you make sand especially for casting your bouquets, mix in a bit of <span class="m">feather alum</span>, this will only make it better. In this way, your mold will be in one piece and it will not be necessary to separate it, but you will have to separate it from the <span class="m">clay</span> once it will have set. Let it dry. And then fire it again until the herbs are burnt. Note that if the herb you want to cast has a strong stalk and stem, you can cast it lying down, as said. But if it is fine and delicate, plant up standing up with the <span class="m">wax</span> peg so that the sand will always raise it up, it being very clear. Do not forget to arrange two vent holes with two small <span class="tl">stick</span>s, which will start at the bottom of the cast, which is the pointed end of the <span class="m">wax</span> peg.
