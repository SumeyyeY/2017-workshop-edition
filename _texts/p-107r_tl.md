 as heavy as before, and it should be like a paste not very thick, &it must not be as easy to stir & as a liquid. This state shows you that it is cooked enough. It must boil in the middle, & all around you must have a thick mixture. If you reheat it too much your mixture would be short of body, because if it becomes red the mixture will lose its strength & it will spoil the <span class="m">sand</span>. Let it cool before mixing it to any other <span class="m">sand</span>. <span class="x">…</span>
 
 
  

## Catching <span class="m"><span class="al">lizards</span></span> and <span class="m"><span class="al">snakes</span></span>

 
Take a stick and attach a string at the end, with has an <span class="del">knot</span> <span class="del">eyelet</span> <span class="add">eyelet</span> that slips at the end. And, being two to three, to distract the lizard while whistling, approach him with the noose of the eyelet, and when he has his head inside, pull. The lizard is more tedious to catch by hand than the serpent & bites without letting go & grips like pincers.
 
Snakes can be caught by hand, provided that it is covered by a thick woollen cloth, for the teeth of the snake stay in the cloth, & and cannot pierce like they would with a linen. The dangerous ones are recognisable by their blue eyes & <span class="del">asses</span> deep azur. They hardly ever bite in water, which crayfish catchers have experienced.
 
The <span class="m">sand</span> mixture is of two thirds of <span class="m">plaster</span>, pulverized & reheated as it is said, & one part of <span class="m">tile</span>, reddened <span class="del">et p pre</span> <span class="add">in a good fire</span>, after the first cooking & then finely pulverized, and of <span class="m">alum de plume</span>, half of brick, namely two full crucibles of plaster, one of brick & a half of alum de plume. There can never be too much alum de plume,<span class="del">s</span> for this is what gives bond to the sand, and because it does not burn, it makes sand withstand the fire without cracking and bursting. Otherwise, without it, the sand would not withstand. This sand, thus composed, is appropriate for all metals, but if you want to use it for gold, it needs more alum de plume <span class="del">&</span>,than the above mentioned composition, and mix in some crocum ferri, and for it is this one that attracts gold.
 
It is necessary that all <span class="m">sand</span> with which you want to cast, withstands the fire well, that is to say that it withstands <span class="del">abon</span> <span class="del">c</span> a great firing without getting spoiled.
 
Alum de plume is troublesome to crush, and it does not pass through the sieve. Thusly one ought to grind it finely on <span class="m">marble</span>. And the one, white <span class="del">que v</span> in powder form, that <span class="pro">apothecaries</span> sell, is good. It is finely ground better <span class="del">su</span> in the mortar by crushing &dragging the pinon, thus you will render it very fine.
 
<span class="m">Crocum ferri</span> must be set ablaze in a <span class="pro">glassworker</span>’s furnace for four days.
