 as heavy as before, and it should be like a paste not very thick, it must not be as easy to stir as a liquid. This state shows you that it is cooked enough. It must boil in the middle, and all around you must have a thick mixture. If you reheat it too much your mixture would be short of body, because if it becomes red the mixture will lose its strength and it will spoil the <span class="m">sand</span>. Let it cool before mixing it to any other <span class="m">sand</span>. [â€¦]
 
 
  

## Catching <span class="m"><span class="al">lizards</span></span> and <span class="m"><span class="al">snakes</span></span>

 
Take a stick, pin a net with a slipknot to the top. Whistle, and move the net nearer to the head of the lizard, and pull when it put it's head inside the net. It is more difficult to take a lizard with your hands than a snake, because lizards bite without letting go, and bite as strong as pincers.
 
You can take snakes with your hand, but cover your handle with a woollen cloth, because the teeth of the snake could go through a common cloth. You can recognize dangerous snakes by their blue eyes. They do not bite into water, as it is known by <span class="pro">crayfish catchers</span>.
 
The <span class="m">sand</span> mixture is made of two thirds of ground <span class="m">plaster</span>, reheated as it is said before, and of one part of reddened <span class="m">tiles</span> which are finely ground afterwards. Use also <span class="m">stone alum</span>, half of the quantity of the <span class="m">tiles</span>. Use two full pots of <span class="m">plaster</span>, one pot of <span class="m">tile</span> and half a pot of <span class="m">stone alum</span>. Do not use too much <span class="m">stone alum</span> because that binds the <span class="m">sand</span>, and allow <span class="m">sand</span> to withstand fire without cracking or breaking. Without it [<span class="m">stone alum</span>] <span class="m">sand</span> would not withstand fire, you can use it for all kind of <span class="m">metal</span>, but for <span class="m">gold</span> add a bigger quantity of <span class="m">stone alum</span>, add also <span class="m">crocum ferri</span>, because they [these <span class="m">filings</span>] attract <span class="m">gold</span>.
 
All the <span class="m">sands</span> you will cast, must withstand fire very well, it must withstand high temperature without spoiling anything.
 
It is difficult to grind <span class="m">stone alum</span>, and it cannot be sieved, you must grind it on a <span class="m">marble</span> slab. The white [<span class="m">stone alum</span>] powder the <span class="pro">apothecaries</span> sell is good, it is easy to crush it into a mortar, use the pestle slowly, that way you will make it [the <span class="m">stone alum</span>] very fine.
 
<span class="m">Crocum ferri</span> must be heated into a <span class="pro">glassworker'</span>s furnace during four days.
