with the <span class="m">material of a frying pan</span> mixed with a knob of <span class="m">potin</span>. And before that, I had so reheated my molded box frame, now on the flame of my stove, now putting glowing <span class="m">coals</span> beneath it, that it became almost red. I let it cool and cast it. It came out with a quite neat relief on one side & hollow on the other, as much the figure as the letters. It is true that the material was whitish, as though it were metallic, but this was because of the <span class="m">potin</span>. I made another cast with <span class="m">frying pan material</span>, alone in the same <span class="m">sand</span>, but not as reheated. It did not come out well.
 
Then I molded burned <span class="m">bull's foot bone</span>, pulverized & strained through a double sieve, & wet with <span class="m">egg white</span> or <span class="m">wine</span> boiled with <span class="m">the root of an elm</span>. I lightly knocked on top of it while molding. While opening the box frame, I found that the figures had come out not at all clean & it left the molds as though they were floury & crumbling. I wet the <span class="m">bone sand</span> more so that it held together well between the figures, and in this way I molded neatly with good come—away. And even though it seemed like the ground <span class="m">bone</span> was lumpy, when casting with <span class="m">frying pan material</span>, it turned out that my figures were quite clean. It is true that I had really really heated up my box frame, it did not admit but one cast. I find that, when a <span class="m">sand</span> is so fine that it gets as heavy as <span class="m">ceruse</span> & even, without finding it arid, thin, sandy & rather spongy, that <span class="sup">sic</span> it molds quite neatly but it does not receive <span class="m">metal</span> very well, as if it were porous and sucking up the material. But, being fatty & even, it puffs up & does not receive subtle impressions at all. I believe that the secret of casting well lies in finding a <span class="m">sand</span> that conforms well to the <span class="m">metal</span>, this one for <span class="m">lead</span>, the other for another, because each has its own particular one, so that it be molded easily & keenly. Then let it firm up on its own for a few days if you have the leisure for it. And afterwards let it really heat up again, not instantly nor with a large fire, but little by little, otherwise it will crumble & always have some defects. Finally you must cast <span class="m">copper</span> or <span class="m">latten</span> or other <span class="m">great metals</span> very hot & if possible with a large quantity of material that has a lot more heat than a small quantity. It's necessary that the box frame be cold & that you cast all in one go. Always lute the opening of your box frame because <span class="m">metal</span> touching fire or <span class="m">metal</span>.

>   This <span class="m">bone</span> has to be really crushed in a mortar, it must not be reheated very much, because then it would crumble.
