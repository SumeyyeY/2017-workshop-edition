*[continued]*
  
and place it on a flat & well—clean table, & since it has a desiccative quality, I knew it would dry out. I left it to dry for a while to reduce it to a powder & mold it with <span class="m">sand</span>, it having been ground into small pieces with my fingers & the sharp side of a knife. I <span class="m">oil</span>ed my medal because <span class="m">oil</span> cleans it without damaging it. And after cleaning & drying the medal with a <span class="m">cloth</span> & small bristle brush of <span class="m">pork skin</span>, I lightly <span class="m">oil</span>ed it once more with clear <span class="m">walnut oil</span>, & gently swiped it with a <span class="m">cloth</span> so that [the medal] would not be too <span class="m">oil</span>ed; having already considered that in this way [the medal] should come out easily, because the <span class="m">white lead,</span> wet with <span class="m">glair</span>, which would not damage the <span class="m">oil</span>. This worked very well. I molded a medal very cleanly in high relief, without it having any lumps, which a lot of good <span class="m">sands</span> such as <span class="m">felt</span>, burnt <span class="m">bone</span>, & <span class="m">iron dross</span> failed to do on the first attempt. I re—cooked it & my mold became hard like marble. And then I knew that <span class="m">sands</span> used to mold big relief must be very moist with some kind of <span class="m">water</span>, which gives body & firmness, like <span class="m">egg white</span>, <span class="m">gummed water</span>, [or] one [<span class="m">water</span>] boiled with <span class="m">elm root</span>. And lightly <span class="m">oil</span> your medal. It can take as many firings as you want because it is as hard as glass. But soft <span class="m">lead</span> & sour <span class="m">tin</span> must be cast at a very hot temperature.
 
Since that moment, I have realized that even though this <span class="m">sand</span> is excellent & can be cast often & molds very neatly, it is fat and it makes bubbles. In this way, the <span class="m">soft lead</span> does not suit the mold well. But I have tried to mix it with lean <span class="m">sand</span>, such as <span class="m">pumice</span>, <span class="m">metal scrapings</span>, & similar things, in order to give it body, & to help it come off easily, because lean <span class="m">sand</span> [alone] does not come off easily; and yet it takes <span class="m">metal</span> well.

>   It is necessary to mold with <span class="m">egg white</span>, and then mix it well. And once it is in the box mold, beat it well on the top with a pestle, or something else clean. This helps to make molding better and come out more easily.

## Green <span class="m">varnish</span> for <span class="m">copper</span> medals

 
After casting them neatly, cover them with <span class="m">glass salts</span>, which we use for sand, & moisten it. & Within three or four days they will be green. Oil them after, & place them under some <span class="m">manure</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Glue</span>

 
The Flemish mend their <span class="m">earthenware</span> pots with <span class="m">or colés</span>, that is to say <span class="m">massicot</span>, <span class="m">minium</span> & <span class="m">varnish</span>.
