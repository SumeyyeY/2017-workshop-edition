## <span class="m">Mastic</span> varnish dried a half hour

 
 Some use 2 ℥ of <span class="m">mastic</span>, half ℥ of <span class="m">turpentine</span> and of <span class="m">turpentine oil</span>, and <span class="m">spirits</span> at your discretion since it evaporates when heated and nonetheless makes a more desiccative varnish. But I made it like this: I use <span class="m">turpentine oil</span>, at my discretion, and add very little <span class="m">turpentine</span>, since it remains humid and gets tacky if we add too much, together with some <span class="m">spirits</span> and heat the <span class="m">oil</span> in a varnished bowl and, as it become very hot I add some finely ground <span class="m">mastic</span> and pass one—third of the <span class="m">oil</span> through a sieve and let this heat up until it is melted, which will occur quickly on hot <span class="m">ashes</span>. Once it is all melted, try it on your knife, and if you see that it has too much body add a bit of <span class="m">turpentine oil</span>, and if it does not, add some <span class="m">mastic</span>. And so it is finished, and keep it well covered so that no rubbish gets in. When you want to make this, take care to separate and choose the <span class="m">mastic</span> that is white and pure of any dirt and dust and black dross. And when you wash it and dry it, make it very white and clean and make it even better, because if you don't purge it of these dregs and marks they will be pulverised into it, remain within the varnish, and when you wipe it onto some white or flesh—tinted <span class="sup">surface</span>, it will seem as if it were spotted and dirty. Having properly selected, pulverise it in a mortar and pass it through a very fine sieve, and afterward mix it in <span class="m">oil</span>, as stated above. But if you want to make it more carefully, take a drop of <span class="m">mastic</span>, as you know, pulverise, pass it, and mix, and you shall have something very singular for small projects. Be well advised when varnishing to not breathe on it for it will make the varnish white and thick.

>   We know that this varnish does not have enough body when it doesn't take well to an <span class="m">oil</span> painting, since it is like <span class="m">water</span>. Add, therefore, powdered <span class="m">mastic</span> and heat it until it is good. This varnish is very white and beautiful not at all like the <span class="m">aspic</span> one.

## To work nearby

 
 It is a strange thing that the workers in this craft can only work if they have good breath, for if they have bad breath their work will crack when refired.
