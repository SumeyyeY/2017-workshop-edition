## To bronze in white

 
Take <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> and put it to soak in <span class="m">gum water</span>, and pound it in a pestle. And afterwards, you will put it on the <span class="m">marble</span>.
 
 
  

## To make <span class="m">vermillion</span>

 
Take two pounds of <span class="m">sulphur</span>, and melt it, and add two pounds of <span class="add"><span class="m">mercury</span></span> to it. And if this material ignites, cover it quite neatly, so that the air does not pass into the pot, then put everything for some time after into a <span class="m">leaded</span> pot, into the fire. In the space of twenty—four hours, you will have good <span class="m">vermillon</span>. 
 
 
  

## To make varnish

 
Take one pound of <span class="m">linseed oil</span>, and then put it in a pot of <span class="m">earth</span> mixed with a <span class="m">bread</span>crust and three <span class="m">onions</span>, and put it on a <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire, and you will cook it on a low fire, and let it boil for the space of five hours. You will take half an ounce of <span class="m">flour glue</span>, and will make it boil just as before, and stir continuously with a spoon. And then afterwards, you will add two ounces of well—pounded <span class="m">sandarac</span> to it, and will do so as above. And then afterwards, you will take <span class="m">mastic</span> and <span class="m"><span class="sup">gum </span>arabic</span>, two ounces of each, both well pounded, and will put everything together, and will have it boil, always stirring, for the space of five hours. And then you will add <span class="m">rock alum</span>, two ounces, and then you will make it boil. And if you add two ounces of <span class="m"><span class="sup">gum </span>arabic</span> to it, if you see that they are not cooked enough, have it cook more on a low
