## To cast

 
<span class="m">Asphalt</span> from Germany is the most excellent <span class="m">sand</span> you can find for molding in a box frame, because it is fitting for <span class="m">silver</span> & for <span class="m">gold</span>. & the more you use it and the older it is, the better it is. With it, one molds very slender & subtle things.
 
 
  

## Making <span class="m">gold</span> run for casting

 
Because <span class="m">gold</span> cools down very quickly, you have to give it a mixture when it is well melted that will keep the heat. <span class="m">Sublimate</span> softens it nicely. But, since it vanishes into smoke, it won't aid you for very long. Therefore mix this mixture into it when you want to cast it: of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, the best <span class="m">verdigris</span> that you can find, a bit of <span class="m">borax</span> & some <span class="m">saltpeter</span>. And this, held over the heat, will become neat. The <span class="m">saltpeter</span> makes it clear & heats it. But the key thing in this mixture is the <span class="m">verdigris</span>, which has to be good. This mixture softens your <span class="m">gold</span> so much that it becomes as tractable as lead, even if it is good <span class="m">gold</span>.
 
For <span class="m">sand</span> for molding flowers & leaves & other delicate things, mix in raw <span class="m">plaster</span>, crushed <span class="m">brick</span> & <span class="m">stone alum</span>.
 
To moisten <span class="m">sand</span>, <span class="m">spirits</span> are excellent because it makes <span class="m">sand</span> fine & leaves in a vapor when you reheat your box frame.
 
<span class="m">Dilute sal ammoniac</span> is very good, is excellent for moistening <span class="m">sand</span>, but for lots of <span class="m">water</span> you only need a little bit of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>.
 
A raw lump of <span class="m">metal</span>, if you don't have <span class="m">crocum ferri</span>, is good for <span class="m">gold</span>.
 
The snakes and the lizards you wish to mold should not be kept for a long time, because if they are alive, they will waste away, and if they are dead, they will decay.
 
<span class="m">Plaster of Paris</span> is as hard as stone & very good. When you want to choose some for your <span class="m">sand</span>, take the rawest and the hardest that is possible for you & that does not make any powder. Transparent <span class="m">plaster</span> and that which makes powder in giving way is that which is not good for this work. A sign of that which is near perfect is that it is hard & makes shining grains that look almost like sugar. Finally, to mix it into the <span class="m">sand</span> to cast <span class="m">gold</span>, it has to be put in the <span class="m">fire</span> twice, & reheated twice.

>   \+ When <span class="m">gold</span> is really pure, it is so dry that it can just barely endure a hammer. But this mixture softens it like <span class="m">lead</span>.
