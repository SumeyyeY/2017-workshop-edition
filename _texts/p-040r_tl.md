being at all expert in painting. If your <span class="m">glass</span> pane is bulging as if taken from the belly of a jar, it will show better. When you apply your <span class="m">turpentine</span> colors to your <span class="m">glass</span> panes, first place them on a hot tile &, once they are hot, spread your colors & leave it a while on the tile, then lay down your <span class="m">tin</span> sheet.
 
 
  

## Dye

 
Some take the root of <span class="pa">Lapathium acutum maius</span>, which looks like <span class="pa"><span class="pro">monk</span>’s—rhubarb</span> or <span class="pa">sorrel</span>, & using the root, which is yellow in summer, they dye threads & similar things.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Aqua fortis</span>

 
Some put <span class="del">on</span> for four pounds of <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> matter <span class="del">four</span> that is in the <span class="tl">retort</span>, four ounces of common <span class="m">water</span> in the container, which is better than putting it into the <span class="tl">retort</span>. The <span class="m">alum</span> is de—phlegmed & calcined such that the <span class="m">water</span> does not have as many dregs. Many make it without de—phlegming the <span class="m">alum</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Vinegar</span>

 
One takes for granted that <span class="del">jec</span> heat red—hot the <span class="m">mineral salt</span> that looks like <span class="m">marble</span> & that is called in <span class="pl">Catalonia</span> & at the border of <span class="pl">Spain</span> <span class="m"><span class="pl">Cardona</span> salt</span>, & throwing it <span class="del">in the</span> red hot or quite hot in <span class="m">wine</span>, it turns it into very good <span class="m">vinegar</span>. Some make it with <span class="m">water</span> poured on pomace soured after being pressed by <span class="pro">grape pickers</span>, but it will not keep & spoils in heat & thunder storms.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Silver gilt</span> buttons

 
Because <span class="m">silver gilt</span> does not fear fire, it is cut into lozenges flat<span class="del">[illegible]</span> on one side, then they are joined together in a star shape with a paste of crushed <span class="m">enamel</span>, which is then melted & the <span class="m">enamel</span> is gilt with <span class="m">gold</span> leaf and then reheated.
 
 
  

## Grottos

 
To fill some empty place that cannot be laden with hanging rocks, one puts a piece of thick <span class="m">parchment</span> close to the fire, which shrinks & crumples. Then one paints it with distemper, then in <span class="m">oil</span>. Next one affixes it.
