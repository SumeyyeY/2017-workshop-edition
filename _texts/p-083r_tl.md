## <span class="m">Sand</span> for <span class="m">lead</span>

 
Recipe: <span class="sup">Take</span> grey <span class="m">soot</span> from the <span class="pro">silversmiths</span>' furnace, <span class="m">quick lime</span>, and <span class="m">flour</span>. Moisten according to [the rules of] the art, in the finest possible way you can.

>   The <span class="pro">locksmiths</span>' grey <span class="m">soot</span> which is held in their forge is quite fine when ground. It molds & is removed very neatly.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span> for <span class="m">copper</span> medals

 
Recipe: <span class="sup">Take</span> hat <span class="m">felt</span> burnt on a covered fire, <span class="m">iron dross</span>, & burnt <span class="m">bone</span>, all of which you should grind very finely & crush & spray with <span class="m">saltwater</span> & make a paste of it & mold it, & wipe it with <span class="m">hay</span> fire. These three pulverized <span class="m">sands</span>, having been very well refined on the <span class="m">porphyry</span> slab, mold very well and cast well. Know that separately each of them is quite good. Burnt <span class="m">felt</span> molds well and is removed quite neatly.

>   <span class="m">Plaster</span> molds quite neatly but it swells. <span class="m">Bone</span> does not have much body while <span class="m">iron dross</span> does. <span class="m">Felt</span> allows for an easy removal of the cast.
 
 
  

## Other <span class="m">sand</span>

 
<span class="sup">Take</span> <span class="m">charcoal</span> made from <span class="m">vine shoots</span> & <span class="m">clay earth</span>, <span class="del">bien recuitte &</span>both well searced, & mix them with well—beaten <span class="m">egg white</span>. Next calcinate it <span class="sup">the resulting paste</span> in the oven & to use it, dillute it in <span class="m">vinegar</span>.
 
 
  

## Other <span class="sup"><span class="m">sand</span></span> for <span class="sup">use with</span> <span class="m">lead</span>

 
Recipe: <span class="sup">Take</span> finely crushed <span class="m">slate</span> & <span class="m">pumice stone</span> mixed together. Calcinate them three times in a covered & sealed pot in strong fire, & each time dilute them with <span class="m">urine</span>.
 
 
  

## Other <span class="sup"><span class="m">sand</span></span>

 
Recipe: <span class="sup">Take</span> a <span class="m">tile</span> that has not been cooked too much, grind it & diluted it in <span class="m">white wine</span> with burnt black trasse <span class="m">paper</span>. If you add burnt horse <span class="m">manure</span> to it, it will be all the better. Moisten with <span class="m">egg white</span>.

> 
>   Trasse paper burnt under a light fire becomes akin to <span class="m">soft black charcoal</span>. It molds nealty & is removed easily when mixed with the others <span class="sup">ingredients or sands?</span>.
 
 
  

## Excellent <span class="m">sand</span>

 
Burn <span class="m">alabaster</span> in a crusol under charcoal fire until it turns into powder. Once <span class="sup">it is</span> cold, finely pulverise it through a sieve & make it impalpable. With a pound of <span class="m">alabaster</span>, one should use an ounce of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>. Mix well & incorporate everything together. Next, put it in a cave or a wet location. And with this paste, mold whatever you need & then dry the mold under a fire & while the <span class="m">sand</span> is hot, you cast whatever metal you may like and your cast will be as neat as the principal. & the <span class="m">sand</span> <span class="sup">will</span> always work if it is kept in a wet location & dried by the fire.
