## Grafting

 
Any tree that has a large pith will be hard to <span class="del">be</span> graft from, because the cutting is difficult to remove. If the pith is damaged, the graft will take in an unstraight manner, like with vines of all peach and apricot trees.
 
Apricot trees have a very thin <span class="m">bark</span>, and so it is necessary to graft them onto young trees whose own <span class="m">bark</span> is not thick yet, such as the young shoots of prune trees or apricot trees.
 
The graft will not take if the cutting gets wet. It is necessary therefore to graft in serein and mild weather, not too cold and not too windy.
 
One must use <span class="m">old wood</span> to graft, if one wants to graft on a tree that is already mature and quite big; because if this is the case, it will compress the cutting, and if the cutting is of <span class="m">young wood</span>, it will not grow properly. But <span class="m">old wood</span> resists the compression of <span class="m">old wood</span> better <span class="del">than the young</span>, because it is harder than <span class="m">young wood</span>. But if the graft is done with only <span class="m">old wood</span>, it will never grow beautifully, but will be frail and short and will take a long time to grow.

 
  

## Molding with <span class="m">cuttlefish bone</span>

 
Pay attention to keep the <span class="m">bones</span> in a dry place, because they are very prone to dampness. If you have a small medal, divide the <span class="m">bone</span> into two pieces, then smooth the two parts with a knife. And on a dry, smooth <span class="m">rooftile</span> [that has been] pulverized with <span class="m">willow charcoal</span>, rub and polish the two half <span class="m">bones</span>. In this way, the <span class="m">bones</span> soak up the <span class="m">willow charcoal</span> so that the <span class="m">bones</span> will come off cleanly from the cast, and will not stick to it. Then on a <span class="m">fake bone</span>, that is to say a bit of smooth <span class="m">brick</span> of the same width as your <span class="m">bone</span>, place your medal. And then on the medal, put your <span class="m">bone</span> and press it firmly with another stone of the same size. And for a second time, mold it, and instead smooth over the top with <span class="m">willow charcoal</span> and blow slowly, then press as before, and it will cast neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, two whole <span class="m">bones</span> are needed. Any work that is cast is brittle and prone to breaking, because the <span class="m">metal</span> swells when cast, and contracts and condenses when hammered. That is why it is necessary to retrace with a chisel the cast object and in this way the <span class="m">metal</span> will contract again and let it escrouir. If the piece you have to cast is in high relief, first trace the mold and the hollow with a penknife, to make a clear path for the medal and then cast it. And if the medal has two sides
