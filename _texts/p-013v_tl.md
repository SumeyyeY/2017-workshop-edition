 passing through so well. But for this effect, choose yellow and natural raw <span class="m">silk</span> because it is stronger and rejects <span class="m">flour</span> as <span class="m"><span class="al">horse</span>hair</span> does.

 
  

## To recognize the good kind of <span class="m">azurite ash</span> for <span class="m">oil</span>

 
The one that piles up in small clods and is lumpy is the best because it is delicate. Also the one that is also very pale in color, because <span class="m">oil</span> darkens it. Certain <span class="pro">sophisticators</span> mix them, but you will know this if you pour some onto a piece of <span class="m">paper</span> & lay it flat & smudge it with the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span> since, if it is mixed, it will be found variegated & as if with pale & darker stripes, but if it is unmixed it will be even & of one color. 
 
 
  

## Whitening of <span class="m">pearls</span>

 
When they have been applied in embroidery on some garment, they are greasy & are cleaned in <span class="m">soapy water</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Toadstone</span>

 
That which comes from the head of the <span class="al">toad</span> and has the shape of the <span class="al">toad</span>, painted naturally as you have seen, is the most excellent. It is said that if powder made from it is put on a <span class="tl">brazier</span> in someone's room at night, they will be unable to move, speak, or stop <span class="pro">thieves</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Snakes</span>

 
It is said that if one calls a <span class="al">snake</span> in Greek, saying ΟΦΗ ΟΦΗ, it will flee. Likewise, if one <span class="del">nom</span> calls a <span class="al">swine</span> in Greek, <span class="del">y</span> ïon, it will come. 
 
 
  

## Candles

 
<span class="pro">Candlemakers</span> never make good candles when the <span class="env">autan</span> wind blows because they always melt, however good is the <span class="m">tallow</span> they use in them.
