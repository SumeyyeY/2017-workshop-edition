*[continued]*
  
You must make at least three layers of flesh color in order to paint faces in <span class="m">oil</span>. And to begin, one places the black and shadow where it is appropriate. After, the highlighting with <span class="m">lead white</span> must not be placed on the black. Flesh colors and [missing word] containing <span class="m">ceruse</span> will yellow in five or six months, but <span class="m">lead white</span> does not change.
 
<span class="m"><span class="pl">Florence</span> lake</span> is better than <span class="sup"><span class="m">lake</span></span> from <span class="pl">Flanders</span> because in <span class="pl">Florence</span> they make the best dyes. To make a beautiful flesh color, the reddest and brightest <span class="m">lake</span> is the best, because those that are purple and violet as a result of the addition of too much <span class="m">alum</span> look like the flesh of someone that is very cold. That is why women who want to color their cheeks crush <span class="m"><span class="pl">Florence</span> lake</span> very finely, then fill a little <span class="m">cotton</span> with it, which they then wrap in a little fine <span class="m">cambric</span>. And thus they rub the <span class="m">lake</span> on their <span class="bp">cheeks</span> and then, with another clean <span class="m">cotton</span>, they soften it.
 
<span class="m">Crystallin</span> having been crushed in <span class="m">water</span> appears to have body, but in <span class="m">oil</span> it does not have any. It is crushed with <span class="m">lake</span> and with <span class="m">bitumen</span>, which would not dry for a very long time otherwise.
 
<span class="m">Aspic oil</span> is commonly put with <span class="m">lead white</span>, not entirely pure but mixed with a little <span class="m">walnut oil</span>. The said <span class="m">aspic oil</span> will not be good for <span class="m">lake</span> and colors that do not have body because it will make them crack, but with those that have body and are somewhat greasy, it is quite appropriate.
 
<span class="m">Verdigris</span> and <span class="m">orpiment</span> must be first crushed with <span class="m">urine</span> rather than thinned with <span class="m">oil</span>. Thus they are beautiful and do not fade.
