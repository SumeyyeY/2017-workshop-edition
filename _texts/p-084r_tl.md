## Impromptu mask

 
Mold some <span class="m">paper</span> & put it on the face of somebody who is making an ugly grimace. Let it dry & take your pattern to paint from it
 
 # & swellings. It is necessary that it not be too wet for the above said reasons. Reheat little <span class="add">by little</span>. And if, after having been molded, you leave it to dry slowly, in some dry place, & not over a big fire, it would be better, for when one exposes it all at once to intense heat, it swells. I believe that reheating it at the mouth of the furnace, after you have taken the bread out, would be well proper. One ought not complain about the difficulty of preparing it, for it withstands as many castings as you wish, because it renders itself hard as marble & you can polish it & the mold cannot be spoiled. Having been used, crush & sieve again, yet without being so scrupulous as to render it very fine, <span class="del">I</span> for once passed only through a common sieve, it has more force and releases better, than when it is so fine.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Eau magistra</span>

 
Dissolve <span class="m">rock salt</span> or finely pulverized <span class="m">sandever</span> salt & put on <span class="m">marble</span> in a cellar, & it will dry out by reheating the mold, & will give it a bond to withstands several castings. Try to moisten it with tartar oil.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Flour</span>

 
Ground during <span class="tmp">Advent</span>, keeps for the whole year.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span> from a mine in <span class="pl">Toulouse</span>

 
The <span class="m">sand from <span class="pl">Toulouse</span></span>, which is taken, from the depths of the earth, from the small hill of Puy David, is excellent in itself, but to make it withstand several castings, I mix it with pulverized <span class="m">sandever</span> & moistened, which hardens it, & takes body & bond with it, & makes it withstand <span class="del">more than five</span> as many castings as you wish. Try to moisten the crushed <span class="m">glass</span> and other <span class="del">e</span> sands with the waters of the above mentioned salts. It wants to be, like all <span class="m">natural sand</span>, well reheated before putting it to work. One pulverises it, because it is in a lump, then one reheats it in a <span class="m">copper</span> kettle or similar thing, until it no longer smokes.
