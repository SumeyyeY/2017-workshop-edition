## Impromptu mask

 
Mold some <span class="m">paper</span> & put it on the face of somebody who is making an ugly grimace, let it dry & take your pattern to paint
 
 # &liftings. It is necessary that it not be too wet for the aforementioned reasons. Reheat little by little, and if you left it out to dry slowly in some dry place & without any high heat after molding it, it would work better, since if you expose it all of a sudden to high heat, it warps. I think it would be very convenient to reheat it in the mouth of the oven after you take bread out of it. One should not complain about the difficulty of preparing it; it can take as many castings as you wish, because it becomes as hard as marble & you can polish it, & the mold cannot be ruined. Having used it, crush & sift it again, without making a special effort to crush it very finely, since, when sifted through a common sieve, it is stronger and strips better than when it is very fine.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Magistry</span>

 
Dissolve <span class="m">rock salt</span> or <span class="m">sandever</span> that you have pulverized finely & placed on a <span class="m">marble</span> slab in a pot & it will dry out while you reheat the mold, & will provide it with a binding to enable several castings. Try moistening it with <span class="m">tartar oil</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Flour</span>

 
Ground during <span class="tmp">Advent</span> lasts the whole year.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span> from a <span class="pl">Toulousain</span> mine

 
<span class="m"><span class="pl">Toulousain</span> sand</span>, which is harvested from the Côteau du Puy—David, deep down in the earth, is excellent on its own, but to make it sustain multiple castings, I mix it with pulverized & moistened <span class="m">sandever</span>, which hardens it & holds well together with it, & enables as many castings as you like. Try to moisten the crushed <span class="m">glass</span> and other sands with the <span class="m">essences of the aforementioned salts</span>. Like all <span class="m">natural sand</span>, it needs to be reheated well. Before putting it to use, one pulverises it, because it is in a lump, and then one reheats it in a <span class="m">copper</span> boiler (or similar) until it ceases to smoke.

>   It is necessary to reheat it before using it. It becomes better for casting because it is reheated, but when it has been used too much, it must be refreshed with new sand.
