## <span class="m">Amaranth</span> color

 
Although it is said to be immortal, <span class="m">white wine</span> removes its coloration and makes it light red and the dried <span class="m">flower</span> ends up white. Note that <span class="m">wine</span> does so, and I have tried it. <span class="m">Spirits</span> have the same effect.
 
 
  

## Drying of <span class="m">oil</span>

 
If the <span class="m">oil</span> does not dry, put in <span class="m">massicot</span> and <span class="m">minium</span>. There is no better <span class="m">oil</span> than <span class="m">walnut oil</span>, because it does not dry out too quickly nor too slowly.
 
 
  

## Casting

 
The <span class="pl">Germans</span> use <span class="m">lead from <span class="pl">Flanders</span></span> because it is very soft. And to cast better they take <span class="m">lead ore</span> & melt it, & separate what is melted from the from the <span class="m">filth</span> & <span class="m">ore</span>, & pour it into a separate <span class="tl">vessel</span>, then <span class="del">the bottom</span> they cast with it. For the <span class="m">lead</span> must not have been used in works before, but rather completely new. Some cast into <span class="tl">molds of <span class="m">iron</span> & <span class="m">copper</span></span>.

>   or new <span class="m">lead</span> coming from the <span class="env">mine</span>. They melt it twice in a <span class="tl">crucible</span>. In the first one, they cleanse it of <span class="m">filth</span>. In the second, they <span class="del">en</span> cast.
 
 
  

## Shadows

 
German <span class="pro">painters</span> shade their flesh tones with crushed <span class="m">jet</span>, <span class="m">stil de grain yellow</span> and <span class="m">ochre</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Bister</span>

 
It is only employed in distemper, and is used for the color of <span class="m">wood</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Verdigris</span> and another very beautiful, gay green

 
One must not crush it with <span class="m">water</span> alone, because that makes it fade. To make it beautiful in distemper, some crush it with <span class="m">vinegar</span>, but that makes it turn pale and become whitish. To make it beautiful, crush it with <span class="m">urine</span> and leave it to dry. Then, whenever you like, crush it with <span class="m">oil</span>. And after you have collected it with the palette, before you finish cleaning the <span class="m">marble</span>, crush it <span class="sup">there</span> with <span class="m">stil de grain yellow</span>. And you will have a very beautiful green.
