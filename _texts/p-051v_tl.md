which is different from the printers' one, you have to boil for a long time some <span class="m">walnut oil</span> or, even better, some <span class="m">linseed oil</span>, and after boiling for a long time, you will add <span class="m">garlic</span> cloves and <span class="m">bread</span> crusts to skim them and leave again to boil on big fire, then eventually you will add a measure of <span class="m">lampblack</span> that you would have ground with some <span class="m">oil</span> previously on the <span class="m">marble</span>. And lastly you will mix everything and until you see that the plate prints well. And when you will have spread the <span class="m">ink</span>, dry the plate with a white sheet of <span class="m">paper</span> and do that until the <span class="m">paper</span> looks clean and then print. If you dry the plates with a <span class="m">cloth</span>, it would remove the <span class="m">ink</span> off. <span class="m">Linseed oil</span> gets thicker while boiling and becomes similar to a varnish and risks catching fire as soon as you boil it, so make sure that when you boil it, it is in an open space or where the flame cannot damage anything. Some burn some <span class="m">scale</span> until it turns black and grind it with some nonâ€”boiled <span class="m">linseed oil</span> or <span class="m">walnut oil</span> that some consider to be better. This black is beautiful but the <span class="m">lamp smoke</span> one is blacker. When you want to print, take with your finger's end and reasonably spread some of the said <span class="m">black</span> all over the plate previously cleaned with some <span class="m">detergent</span> as said, then, rub it with a white sheet of <span class="m">paper</span> until the paper is completely white and do not touch it with your bare hand but with a <span class="m">paper</span> applied on it. And after cleaning the plate perfectly, rub again the sides and edges with a folded sheet of <span class="m">paper</span>. Then, have [available] a small even table and on it a piece of <span class="m">felt</span>, then a few sheets of <span class="m">paper</span> and eventually the one you want to print on, moistened between two humid <span class="m">napkins</span>. And on this sheet of <span class="m">paper</span>, put your sheet then some more <span class="m">paper</span>, and at least another piece of <span class="m">felt</span>. Then put it through the rollers and you can print a dozen pieces consecutively while always charging the plate with <span class="m">ink</span> and cleaning it as you did. But if you stop printing, the rest of the <span class="m">ink</span> will dry out in the plate's lines and so you will have to let it boil in <span class="m">detergent</span> or <span class="m">urine</span>, as said, to clean it. The rollers must not be too loose.
