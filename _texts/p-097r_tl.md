## <span class="m">Black varnish</span>

 
It is said, at the beginning of the book where you can see it, that it is made with <span class="m">galipot</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Gilding</span>

 
One prepares the hilts very well with a soft, <span class="sup">indeed</span> very soft <span class="m">file</span> until there is no blackness left on the hilts, then heat them, and pass them as has already been said. But to <span class="m">gild</span> and <span class="m">gild</span> with <span class="m">silver</span>, they must not be passed <span class="sup">change their color</span> too much, except maybe leaning towards a blue. Then while the hilts are hot, one ties them to a wood block and with some tweezers you apply the gold and fasten it with the <span class="m">sanguine</span> and the <span class="m">sanguine</span> is very neat and has been rubbed with <span class="m">putty</span>. And when the hilts become cold, reheat them, then apply <span class="m">gold</span> as said above. And you must start with giving the hilt two layers, until it is wellâ€”covered. And then reheat it as you did at beginning, and give it its third layer of <span class="m">gold</span>. Then burnish it with a <span class="m">sanguine</span>, very strongly and with good strength. But note that if you want to burnish well, your hilt must remain warm. And to know this, you bring it close to your nose and smell it. And because you cannot touch it with your fingers, take it out of the warm ashes with a small <span class="m">iron</span> stick, which has been purposely made to fit into the eye of the hilt. And when you have finished burnishing it well, rub it well with a piece of white <span class="m">linen</span>, and make sure your <span class="m">gold</span> is thicker and stronger than the ones <span class="pro">painters</span> use. A quarter of a pound is worth fifty or lx sols.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Gilding</span> with <span class="m">silver</span>

 
You must prepare the hilts and whiten them with a <span class="m">file</span>, coarser than the one used for <span class="m">gold</span>. And you want to pass them <span class="sup">change their color</span> to grey, as you have done for the <span class="m">gold</span>. And since they are warm, you must double the leaves of <span class="m">silver</span> and then divide them with a knife, and then apply them to the hilt with tweezers and a burnisher. And then heat them again, and apply <span class="sup">the silver</span>, until they are all <span class="m">gilded</span> in <span class="m">silver</span>. Then you must apply, for the third time, your doubled leaf as has been said, then burnish them very strongly and with good strength, not with the <span class="m">sanguine</span>, but with a strong burnisher, just as you would not use a burnisher on <span class="m">gold</span>.
