## <span class="m">Black varnish</span>

 
It is said, at the beginning of the book where you can see it, that it is made with <span class="m">galipot</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Gilding</span>

 
One prepares the guards thoroughly with a soft, very <span class="tl">soft file</span> such that there is nothing black left on any of the guards, and next heat them, & pass them as said. But to <span class="m">gild</span> & <span class="m">gild</span> with <span class="m">silver</span>, they ought not to pass, except maybe a little towards blue. Then while the guards are hot, one attaches them to a wood block & with some tweezers one layers the gold & one makes it sit with <span class="m">bloodstone</span>,which is quite clean & rubbed with <span class="m">pottée</span>. And as soon as the guards are cold, one reheats them, then one layers the <span class="m">gold</span> as above. And first one gives <span class="del">de</span> two layers, until the entire guard is well—adorned. And next one reheats as at the beginning, & one gives the third covering of <span class="m">gold</span>. Then one burnishes very thoroughly and with great force with a large <span class="m">bloodstone</span>. <span class="del">And</span> But note that <span class="add">to</span> burnish well, the guard always needs to be warm. And to know this, one smells it & brings it close to the nose. For one ought not to touch with the fingers, but one <span class="del">grasps </span> picks it up from on top of the warm ashes with a small <span class="m">iron</span> rod, which has been purposely made to fit into the eye of the hilt. And when you have finished burnishing it well, rub it well with a piece of white <span class="m">linen</span>, and make sure your <span class="m">gold</span> is thicker and stronger than the ones <span class="pro">painters</span> use. A quarter of a pound is worth fifty or lx s<span class="exp">ols</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Gilding</span> with <span class="m">silver</span>

 
You must prepare the hilts and whiten them with a <span class="m">file</span>, coarser than the one used for <span class="m">gold</span>. And you want to pass them <span class="sup">change their color</span> to grey, as you have done for the <span class="m">gold</span>. And since they are warm, you must double the leaves of <span class="m">silver</span> and then divide them with a knife, and then apply them to the hilt with tweezers and a burnisher. And then heat them again, and apply <span class="sup">the silver</span>, until they are all <span class="m">gilded</span> in <span class="m">silver</span>. Then you must apply, for the third time, your doubled leaf as has been said, then burnish them very strongly and with good strength, not with the <span class="m">sanguine</span>, but with a strong burnisher, just as you would not use a burnisher on <span class="m">gold</span>.
