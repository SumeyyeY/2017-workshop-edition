## Powder of <span class="m">ox bone</span> and <span class="m">rock salt</span>

 
I pulverised them separately & ground them finely on the <span class="m">porphyry</span> as much as I could. Then I mixed all of one with the other & re—ground it on the <span class="m">porphyry</span>. Afterwards I moistened it in <span class="m">paper</span> folded in a moist <span class="m">napkin</span> which is made wet more quickly from the <span class="m">moisture of the night</span>, or the <span class="m"><span class="sup">moisture of</span> the cellar</span>. I have never found <span class="sup">one</span> which can be removed more cleanly from the mold than this, though it needs to be quite moist. And if you want to cast small works, make it very hot. It came out very cleanly from the doulx tin, like the main one, and has sustained several castings. For <span class="m">tin</span>, I believe that it is not necessary to look further to find a material that takes to powder better, and even for use with fine <span class="m">lead</span> which has almost better results than <span class="m">tin</span><span class="del">Tou</span>. The <span class="m">bone of an ox hoof</span> is always dry, that is why you must mix it with fatty <span class="m">sand</span>, & so it will bind like <span class="m">tripoli</span>, <span class="m">salts</span>, <span class="m">felt</span>, <span class="m">ashes</span> & similar materials. <span class="sup">If you do not mix <span class="m">ox—hoof bone</span></span>, it will not turn out from the mold & will not mold cleanly because it crumbles.
 
 
  

## Reheating or wiping a box mold

 
Always arrange the most delicate parts, like faces or handles, so that nothing will fall which would then disturb your fusion.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Natural sand</span>

 
This should not be reheated for <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span>, it is <span class="del"></span> better all new & fresh.
