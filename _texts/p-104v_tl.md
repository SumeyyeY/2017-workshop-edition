## Against dogs' mange

 
For normal—sized dogs, take half an ℥ of <span class="m">stavesacre</span>, and one ℥ for big dogs, as fine powder beaten with two <span class="m">egg whites</span> and one quarteron of <span class="m">oil</span>. They must drink the beverage on an empty stomach, after keeping them locked without any food. Approved.
 
 
  

## For casting

 
If you've got a big piece which does not allow an easy stripping of casting, mold it with some <span class="m">wax</span>, either on the hollow side or in relief, because it is soft and hollow and so can easily be separated from the piece without leaving anything. But be sure that the melted <span class="m">wax</span> is neither too hot nor too cold. Some people use for molding some <span class="m">wax</span> warmed in <span class="m">boiled water</span>, but while pressing the mold it bends and becomes unusable. Once you have made your <span class="m">wax</span> cavity, you can cast in some very soft and clear <span class="m">clay</span>, and let it dry. Then, upon it you will make a <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span> cavity, in which what you will make will easily be stripped.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Goldsmith</span>

 
Know what it is to work on spangled garments, it is small pieces of pure <span class="m">silver</span> and of <span class="m">silver—gilt</span> with which one makes the <span class="pro">archers'</span> coats.

Make an axle surrounded with wheels pierced all around in their thickness and attach feathers as for a cittern or a spinet and arrange them according to the song you want it to play, leaving a suitable distance. And, turning the axle either by yourself or by a clock spring, your invention will effect itself.
