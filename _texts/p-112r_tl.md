## To temper the <span class="m">sand</span>

 
You should have: a large basin full of <span class="m">water</span> to dip the molds into in order to open them, a tankard full of <span class="m">common water</span>, a dish to temper the <span class="m">sand</span>, a small <span class="m">wooden</span> spoon to pick up the mixed <span class="m">sand</span> in the dish.

>   To make handles for your large oil brushes, if you do not have large enough <span class="m">feather pipes</span>, take two of them, melt them and join them together.

## Molding en noyau. Mixing of <span class="m">sand</span>

 
Once you have reheated your <span class="m">sand</span>, that is the <span class="m">plaster</span>, the <span class="m">stone alum</span> and the <span class="m">brick</span>, and once you have finely filtered them through a <span class="m">cloth</span> sieve, # mix them the following way: take four measures of <span class="m">plaster</span>, two measures of <span class="m">bricks</span>, and one measure of <span class="m">stone alum</span>. Mix them all together with the hands, so that one may not discern one [ingredient] from the other. Once your <span class="m">sand</span> is ready, you need to kill the animal that you wish to mold in this way.

## Killing the animal to mold

 
You must have been careful not to hurt it while capturing it. If you have a stock [of animals] and you wish to keep them for a long time, place it in a <span class="m">glass</span> bottle with <span class="m">bran</span> or in a large barrel half full of damp fresh <span class="m">earth</span>. Give them frogs to eat, live rather than dead, because should you keep them without feeding them, they would wither and become emaciated, and their skin would become saggy and wrinkled. Therefore, the sooner after its capture you mold it, the better it will come out. And kill it in the following manner: place it in a clean bottle or vessel so that [the animal] does not carry any <span class="m">dust</span>; fill [the bottle] with enough good <span class="m">vinegar</span> and <span class="m">urine</span> so as to cover [the animal]. Shake [the bottle] and torment [the animal] inside there until it is dead which should take an hour or half an hour. But if you are in a hurry

>   To know if [the animal] is quite dead, take it out of the <span class="m">vinegar</span> and take it by the tail. If it moves its tail, do not mold it because it still has feelings, and when pricking [its members], it would remove itself and harm the mold.
