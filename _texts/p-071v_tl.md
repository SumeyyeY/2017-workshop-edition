## Varnish

 
Add 4 ℥ of <span class="m">sandarac</span> & finely pulverized <span class="m">mastic</span> to a half lb of <span class="m">aspic oil</span>. First of all, boil your <span class="m">oil</span> in a pot on a stove, and then add the aforesaid <span class="m">gum</span> little by little, stirring continually with a small stick split and quartered at the end. & when you cannot collect any more <span class="m">gum</span> on the end, it is totally melted & your varnish is done. And to make it clearer, put into the concoction a little lump of <span class="m">camphor</span>. It is true that with this it will not dry as quickly. Heed well that the <span class="m">aspic oil</span> is quite clear & not at all fatty, otherwise your varnish will not be worth anything. You can test <span class="del"></span> it by soaking some <span class="m">paper</span> in it & heating it. If the <span class="m">oil</span>, which will evaporate, leaves the <span class="m">paper</span> clean, without <span class="del"></span> a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is fatty.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="al">Sheep</span> fat</span>

 
In a certain part of <span class="pl">England</span>, the <span class="al">sheep</span> that graze there have very yellow <span class="m">fat</span> and are nevertheless just as good as others.
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Spider</span>

 
There are no <span class="sup">spiders</span> in <span class="pl">Ireland</span>, & if one touches them with some <span class="m">wood</span> that they have there, they die. That is why some rich people from <span class="pl">England</span> make their floors with this <span class="m">wood</span>, & in this way, they do not have any spiderwebs.
 
 
  

## Sand

 
The cimolée is very good for casting in <span class="m">copper</span>, but one ought not take the one from <span class="pro">culters</span>, because it is only <span class="m">sludge</span>, but rather the one of those who <span class="del">moulent</span> mold large shears.
 
<span class="m">Pierres de filieres</span>, which knife grinders use for whetting, mold very neatly, once scraped, for <span class="m">lead</span>. It is commonly slate—colored. One frequently brings them to <span class="pl">Toulouse</span> from <span class="pl"> around Carcassonne</span> .
