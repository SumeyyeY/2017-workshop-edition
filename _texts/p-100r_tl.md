## <span class="m">Gold</span> color

 
To very quickly make a layer of <span class="m">or <span class="del">sur</span>mat</span> on <span class="m">canvas</span> or on other <span class="m">oil</span> panel, one exposes <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> under the sun or on the fire to make it fatty, as previously mentioned, for it thickens by itself in this way, despite having neither <span class="m">lead</span>, nor <span class="m">ceruse</span>. And with it, crush <span class="m">massicot</span>, <span class="m">mine</span>, & other desiccants, but not <span class="m">vert—de—gris</span> nor <span class="m">orpiment</span>, for they make the <span class="m">gold</span> die. It will quickly be dry. However, if the weather is not serain and dry, do not shade it, for if the weather is dewy & humid, it will turn black.
 
 
  

## Portrait—painting from nature

 
One must carefully <span class="sn">observe </span>the <span class="bp">eyes</span>, the <span class="bp">nose</span>, and the <span class="bp">beard</span>, since these three things contribute much to the resemblance.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Gemstones</span>

 
Your materials need to be pounded in a thick <span class="m">glass</span> <span class="tl">mortar</span> coated with <span class="m">mastic</span> & encased into another <span class="m">wooden</span> <span class="tl">mortar</span>, so that it does not break; this can be useful to <span class="pro">perfumers</span>. & use a <span class="m">glass</span> <span class="tl">pestle</span> too.

## Vitrified <span class="m">saltpeter</span>

 
 Melted with <span class="m">pebbles</span>, it makes the <span class="m">glass</span> very white. But rather, it needs to be calcined on a hot tile or <span class="tl">paddle</span>. And mix the liquid remains of the vapor with as much white, calcined <span class="m">pebbles</span>. It is true that, in the little <span class="tl">oven</span>, it does not make it very clear. But for big windows, it makes the <span class="m">glass</span> very clear, & white & clean.
 
 
  

## Windows through which the sun will not pass

 
Take the aforementioned calcined <span class="m">saltpeter</span> & expose it to a humid air or place, and it will convert itself into a liquid which, if rubbed on both sides of the windows, the sun will not pass through; rather, it will cast shade. One needs to put the <span class="m">saltpeter</span> on any clean place, & put glowing <span class="m">coals</span> on it, and continue all over until it no longer burns.
