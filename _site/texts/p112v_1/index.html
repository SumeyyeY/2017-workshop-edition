<h2 id="affixing-and-arranging-animals">Affixing and arranging animals</h2>

<p>Having gotten in some <span class="material">fat earth</span> called <span class="material">clay</span>, that should be grey, because that is the best one, or another that will bind well and will be well prepared and beaten, so that it is malleable without being damaging your hands or the work, make a lazagne, or a pancake shape, of this <span class="material">clay</span> equally flattened with a rolling pin, which pastry—makers use so that it is slightly thicker than a poulc. And on this pancake, affix your <span class="animal">animal</span>, making it as life—like as possible and the way in which it is naturally shaped. And firstly, with a good <span class="tool">needle</span>, pierce it from underneath, in the middle of the throat, up to the top bone of the head. Then take the <span class="tool">needle</span> out and in the hole, put the point of an <span class="tool"><span class="material">iron</span> wire</span>, of such a length that it suffices to maintain the head of the animal as high as it must be, and if the skin gets in when you put in the wire, take it out with the edge of your small pincer, and arrange the skin as it was before. Pierce the other end of the wire in the sheet of <span class="material">clay</span>. In this way the head will be held high, which will make it more graceful and proud. Arrange afterwards, the rest of the body, and the legs, and the curling as you think will look best. And so that it is secure and does not move when you put in the sand, secure the legs with little points of <span class="tool"><span class="material">iron</span> wire</span>, having already made the first hole with a very sharp <span class="tool">needle</span>. Do the same on the body parts that you deem necessary, making sure that the points going through the animal are fixed in the <span class="material">clay</span> sheet, and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal by a</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>at left top margin of folio 112v</em></p>

  <p>Take a <span class="tool">needle</span> of <span class="material">fine steel</span>, and which will be the sharpest you can find, so that with it, when you make your first hole in order to place the wire threads, it will pass through without effort, and take care not to rudely insert the wire or take skin with it. Then put a thicker wire in the thick bits [of the animal] and the thinner wire in the thinner bits. But take this secret advice and do not plant your pointed wire in one go through the animal and onto the <span class="material">plaster</span>, but having planted it, take it out of the <span class="material">clay</span> earth but not out of the animal, which is afterwards fastened there. One does this because by fastening the point the first time, it pushes in the skin of the <span class="material">serpent</span> and by taking the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>at left bottom margin of folio 112v</em></p>

  <p>When you reuse the points you have already used, make sure to clean them well of rust, so that they do not take away some skin.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>at bottom margin of folio 112v</em></p>

  <p>The main arrangement of your casting is to keep its head very high and have it looking sideways. For this effect, pierce the head on a solid plank or table, making the wire pass through the bottom of the throat up to the top of the head</p>

<p>a bit so that you can take it out if you need to. And be advised that these <span class="tool">needle</span> points must be of the thinnest kind of <span class="tool"><span class="material">iron</span> wire</span>, with a length that is suitable to the animal; because the smaller your <span class="tool">needle</span> is, the smaller the leftover hole will be. However, you must have different sized ones because there are some needles that go on the body and in places that are thicker, like under the throat, and some needles must be longer and stronger than the ones used on legs and thin places, where the <span class="tool">needles</span> must be subtle and thin, almost like the biggest harpsichord strings. And it would be better if they were of <span class="tool"><span class="material">iron</span> wire</span>, which is firmer than the one made of <span class="material">latten</span>. And if piece of a tail, a piece of nail or a piece of leg to the body needs to be joined to the body, do not use the <span class="tool">needle</span>; it would damage these parts. But apply a bit of <span class="material">wax</span>, as big as a grain of millet, between the body and the end of the tail. Then with a bit of <span class="tool"><span class="material">iron</span> wire</span>, flattened and warm, touch the <span class="material">wax</span> and join the two pieces by applying a bit of pressure. In this way, after your animal has been well—placed on the lute—shaped pancake of clay earth,

 build around it a wall of the same clay

 in this way. And join everything together. And then with a big <span class="tool">knife</span>, with which you have cut the <span class="material">clay</span>, take away the extraneous clay surrounding the pancake. And place on a piece at the end of the mold to close it off, as you see in B. Then, with a <span class="tool">small curved instrument</span>, mark on the inside of your mold the thickness you wish, which for a <span class="animal">common serpent</span> must be two inches thick; so that when you put in your wet <span class="material">sand</span>, you will see when it is thick enough. When all of this is neatly set out, moisten well the shaped body of the animal everywhere, with <span class="material">good spirits</span>, with a <span class="tool">brush</span>. For this is the best—kept secret: because everything that is touched by <span class="material">spirits</span> will come out very neatly and without any small eyes or holes that we call bubbles, which usually come not at the back or in the thick sides of the mold, but on the edges. And as soon as you have thusly moistened everything with <span class="material">spirits</span>, put in your wet <span class="material">sand</span> without letting the <span class="material">spirits</span> evaporate, which they do quickly. And soak it thusly and make sure the <span class="tool">needle</span> is as long as you need according to how much you want to raise the head, and that both ends are sharp. Having been arranged thusly, affix your <span class="animal">serpent</span> on the <span class="material">clay earth</span>, and place the head first and then the rest.</p>

  <p><em>at left middle margin of folio 113r</em></p>

  <p>If, once you have placed you animal on sheet of <span class="material">clay</span>, you are distracted with other occupations, rub your animal with <span class="material">spirits</span> and under the belly so that it does not stick or attach itself to the <span class="material">clay earth</span>.</p>

  <p>If, when you pierce the belly of your animal, it releases <span class="material">water</span> on the <span class="material">plaster</span>, clean it well with <span class="material">cotton</span> because the <span class="material">sand</span> that was wet will become lumpy. If it is on top of the animal, clean it very carefully and very neatly and touch it and strongly wet it with <span class="material">spirits</span>.</p>
