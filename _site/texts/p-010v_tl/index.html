<p>One needs to make a layer of <span class="m">batture</span>, which is made <span class="del">of well cooked honey &amp; <span class="m">turpentine</span></span> of <span class="m">colle forte</span> soaked for 24 <span class="ms">hours</span> in <span class="m">water</span> then gently bring to the boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little <span class="m">honey</span> to soften it, &amp; let it boil all together. And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in <span class="m">oil</span>, which will soften the layer even more, and which can also serve to make a ground layer for <span class="m">gold</span>. <span class="m">Water of alum</span> also keeps <span class="m">oil</span> from running.</p>

<p>Make very clear <span class="m">starch glue</span>, showing no body. And make thereof six or five layers, &amp; on the last, once it is half dried, apply your <span class="m">gold</span>.</p>

<p>Rub your weapons or other gilt objects with <span class="m">dry <span class="al">horse</span> dung</span>.</p>

<p>Hardâ€”boil <span class="m">eggs, divide them in half &amp; take the yolk out, &amp; between the two halves of the white</span> put a piece of <span class="m">ceruse</span>, &amp; tie them together with <span class="tl">thread</span>. Then boil in <span class="m">clear water</span>, &amp; it will become entirely black, &amp; thus the <span class="m">ceruse</span> will be purified. Some reheat it over fire &amp; it becomes very white.</p>
