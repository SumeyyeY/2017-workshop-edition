<p><em>[continued]</em></p>

<p>and place it on a flat &amp; well—clean table, &amp; since it has a desiccative quality, I knew it would dry out. I left it to dry for a while to reduce it to a powder &amp; mold it with <span class="m">sand</span>, it having been ground into small pieces with my fingers &amp; the sharp side of a knife. I <span class="m">oil</span>ed my medal because <span class="m">oil</span> cleans it without damaging it. And after cleaning &amp; drying the medal with a <span class="m">cloth</span> &amp; small bristle brush of <span class="m">pork skin</span>, I lightly <span class="m">oil</span>ed it once more with clear <span class="m">walnut oil</span>, &amp; gently swiped it with a <span class="m">cloth</span> so that [the medal] would not be too <span class="m">oil</span>ed; having already considered that in this way [the medal] should come out easily, because the <span class="m">white lead,</span> wet with <span class="m">glair</span>, which would not damage the <span class="m">oil</span>. This worked very well. I molded a medal very cleanly in high relief, without it having any lumps, which a lot of good <span class="m">sands</span> such as <span class="m">felt</span>, burnt <span class="m">bone</span>, &amp; <span class="m">iron dross</span> failed to do on the first attempt. I re—cooked it &amp; my mold became hard like marble. And then I knew that <span class="m">sands</span> used to mold big relief must be very moist with some kind of <span class="m">water</span>, which gives body &amp; firmness, like <span class="m">egg white</span>, <span class="m">gummed water</span>, [or] one [<span class="m">water</span>] boiled with <span class="m">elm root</span>. And lightly <span class="m">oil</span> your medal. It can take as many firings as you want because it is as hard as glass. But soft <span class="m">lead</span> &amp; sour <span class="m">tin</span> must be cast at a very hot temperature.</p>

<p>Since that moment, I have realized that even though this <span class="m">sand</span> is excellent &amp; can be cast often &amp; molds very neatly, it is fat and it makes bubbles. In this way, the <span class="m">soft lead</span> does not suit the mold well. But I have tried to mix it with lean <span class="m">sand</span>, such as <span class="m">pumice</span>, <span class="m">metal scrapings</span>, &amp; similar things, in order to give it body, &amp; to help it come off easily, because lean <span class="m">sand</span> [alone] does not come off easily; and yet it takes <span class="m">metal</span> well.</p>

  <p>Oil &amp; smear with <span class="m">aspic oil</span>, which will disappear when reheated, because the <span class="m">oil</span> causes bubbling.</p>

  <p>It is necessary to mold with <span class="m">egg white</span>, and then mix it well. And once it is in the box mold, beat it well on the top with a pestle, or something else clean. This helps to make molding better and come out more easily.</p>

  <p>It is best to fill the box mold in one go, because the mixture made of several <span class="m">sands</span>, and the one from mines, that you use to fill the box mold, damages it.</p>
