<p>When <span class="sup"><span class="al">a snake</span></span> has eaten something; when twisting it, it will vomit <span class="sup">the food</span>. And if, after having eaten something, <span class="sup">the snake</span> is pressed underfoot, this troubles <span class="sup">the snake</span> a lot and makes it sick. If <span class="sup">the snake</span> is wounded, it will not eat voluntarily.</p>

<h2 id="span-classalmusselsspan"><span class="al">Mussels</span></h2>

<p>There is nothing better for opening them up than to oil them with <span class="m">olive oil</span>, and nothing else. And afterwards, when you want to separate them, soak them in cold <span class="m">water</span>; that is the secret. And you will see that the <span class="m">oil</span><span class="m">,</span> although it seems to be imbued, will separate itself <span class="sup">from the water</span> as <span class="sup">does</span> grease. <span class="al">Mussels</span> become stronger in cold <span class="m">water</span>, and warm <span class="m">water</span> would dissolve them with difficulty, although having been reheated, <span class="sup">the mussels</span> are <span class="sup">then</span> more handleable and easy to dissolve in the <span class="m">water</span>.</p>

<h2 id="span-classmwheat-oilspan"><span class="m">Wheat oil</span></h2>

<p>Is made on a blade of <span class="m">iron</span> reddened in the fire, and the <span class="m">oil</span> turns into drops, which is appropriate to oil the hair of a butterfly or similar thing, because this <span class="m">oil</span> is instantly dry and makes the rest dry out. It is necessary that the coat or down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, because <span class="sup">if left</span> standing up, it will make the sand raise up and form bubbles.</p>

<h2 id="a-cast-of-span-classmleadspan-or-span-classmtinspan">A cast of <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span></h2>

<p>Because you want to cast <span class="m">tin</span> very thinly, if your medal, plant or other thing <span class="sup">you want</span> to mold is thin and fine, make <span class="sup">sure</span> to include more <span class="m">tin</span>, much more than <span class="m">lead</span>, namely less than the fourth part of <span class="m">lead</span> for three of <span class="m">tin</span>. And moreover, one only puts <span class="m">lead</span> in as an alloy. Contrarily, if you want to mold something strong and thick, put a lot more <span class="m">lead</span> in than <span class="m">tin</span>. And for the one and the other you can put in a little <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span>, but only a very little, with a little <span class="m">resin</span>, when you want to cast. Since then, when molding with pure new <span class="m">lead</span>, I put in two ounces of pure <span class="m">tin</span> for every pound <span class="sup">of <span class="m">lead</span></span>. And when molding with pure <span class="m">tin</span>, I put in two ounces of pure <span class="m">lead</span> for every pound <span class="sup">of <span class="m">tin</span></span>. I made some plants and snakes as if they were real.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>at left bottom margin</em></p>

  <p>I cast <span class="m">tin</span> <span class="sup">when it was</span> nearly red, and the same thing with <span class="m">lead</span>, which however had not remained in the fire for too long, because it becomes brittle and burns up.</p>
