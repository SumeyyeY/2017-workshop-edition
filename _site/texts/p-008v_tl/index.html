<h2 id="polishing-of-the-span-classmbalas-rubyspan">Polishing of the <span class="m">balas ruby</span></h2>

<p>It is not polished with <span class="m">tripoli</span> <span class="del">but</span> like the others, but with <span class="m">marcasite powder</span> &amp; <span class="m">oil</span>.</p>

<h2 id="span-classmor-span-classsupmouluspanspan-et-span-classmargent-mouluspan"><span class="m">Or <span class="sup">moulu</span></span> et <span class="m">argent moulu</span></h2>

<p>You need to calcine your <span class="m">fine gold</span> with <span class="m">☿</span> and then wipe your amalgam well &amp; make the said <span class="m">mercury</span> fly off. Next grind it on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> with <span class="m">gum water</span>. As for <span class="m">silver</span> one needs to take it as is &amp; eat away at it with <span class="m">aqua fortis</span>, then take it out with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> blade</span> &amp; rinse it thoroughly and next grind it with <span class="m">gum water</span>.</p>

<h2 id="polishing-span-classmstonesspan">Polishing <span class="m">stones</span></h2>

<p>There are three <span class="tl">wheels for doing this, one of <span class="m">tin</span>, one of <span class="m">lead</span>, &amp; one of <span class="m">fine copper</span></span>, on the <span class="del">cu</span> <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> wheel</span> one does not commonly cut <span class="del">co</span> or polish but the <span class="m">diamond</span>, the <span class="m">ruby</span>, <span class="m">sapphire</span>, &amp; <span class="m">oriental jacinth</span>. The <span class="tl"><span class="m">tin</span> wheel</span> is for more tender stones like <span class="m">emerald</span>, <span class="m">amethyst</span>, &amp; others.</p>

<h2 id="span-classpropewterersspan-mixture-span-classdelspan-classillspanspan"><span class="pro">Pewterers</span>’ mixture <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span></h2>

<p>Because among the <span class="m">fine tin</span>they often mix well <span class="ms">half</span> of <span class="m">lead</span>, which renders the <span class="m">tin</span> dull. To correct this, they mix in some <span class="m">latten filings</span> to render it <span class="sn">sonorous</span>.</p>

<h2 id="perfect-amalgam">Perfect amalgam</h2>

<p>Take the most delicate <span class="m">stoneware</span> you can find, with a cavity in the middle. Put in an <span class="ms">eighth part</span> of <span class="m">☿</span> <span class="del">in</span> &amp; rub it &amp; wear it down while adding <span class="m">water</span>, <span class="m">urc</span>, <span class="m">☾</span> or <span class="m">☼</span> until the substance becomes like paste &amp; even harder. Next, if you want, eat it away with good <span class="m">aqua fortis</span>, if it is <span class="m">☾</span> or <span class="m">♀</span>. Then remelt it, having taken it out as you know. The <span class="m">☾</span> will be colored, and having been melted, will leave some grains of <span class="m">☼</span>, &amp; the <span class="m">♀</span> will be very fine &amp; will have almost no chappe.</p>
