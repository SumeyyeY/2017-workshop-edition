<h2 id="semilively-colors">Semi—lively colors</h2>

<p>When colors <span class="del">a</span>absorb into the <span class="m">canvas</span>, it means that it has been primed only once, &amp; for this reason they become matte without <span class="add">being</span> shiny. But this is the best way, as long as you re—coat it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having more body, do not die &amp; are all the more beautiful for it, especially <span class="m">azure</span> ,<span class="m">lake</span> &amp; those do not have body. But those who want to rush their painting prime twice on the first go, to be done with it. Thus the colors do not absorb, also they will not last as long. The second layer of these does not absorb &amp; remains shiny.</p>

<h2 id="painting-large-figures">Painting large figures</h2>

<p>You need to put your <span class="m">charcoal</span> at the tip of a <span class="tl">stick</span> such that you make your first drawing from a distance because up close, you would not be able to judge proportions as well as from a certain &amp; sufficient distance. Also, when you paint up close, hold your <span class="m">charcoal</span> at the farthest end, &amp; practically with your <span class="bp">fingertips</span>. For in this way you will acquire an<span class="pro"> artist</span>’s <span class="del">l</span> touch &amp; give your <span class="bp">hand</span> effortless facility.</p>

<h2 id="glazing">Glazing</h2>

<p>One usually glazes with colors which do not have body, such as <span class="m">lake</span> &amp; <span class="m">verdigris</span>. However, to use other kinds, one mixes in plenty of <span class="m">calcined &amp; crushed cristallin</span>, which also has no body &amp; <span class="del">makes</span> lightens their thickness.</p>

<h2 id="white-and-black">White and black</h2>

<p>It is good that an <span class="pro">apprentice</span> should work with white &amp; black for two or three <span class="tmp">years</span> to become an <span class="pro">artist</span>.</p>

<p>It does not die &amp; has a lot of body.</p>

<p>** After nature **</p>

<p>There are some who paint after nature on <span class="m">oiled paper</span>, &amp; if they do not finish in one go, they put their <span class="m">paper</span> &amp; unfinished picture in <span class="m">water</span> so that it shall not dry.</p>

  <p><span class="pro">Illuminators</span> painting on <span class="m">paper</span> temper their colors with <span class="m">gum</span> &amp; mix in a little <span class="m">soap</span> to make them run better.</p>

  <p><span class="pro">Painters</span> must all learn how to draw after nature, for to them it is travel provisions &amp; revenue &amp; sure means of earning their passage when travelling across the lands with only their <span class="m">cocon</span>.</p>

<p>** Priming layer **</p>

<p>One needs to be quite careful about this, &amp; not do it, as some will, with gold color which is made with the washing water of <span class="tl"><span class="m">oil</span> pinceaulx</span>, because <span class="m">verdigris</span> &amp; other corrosive colors which are in it will in the end cause the death of the colors that are <span class="del">meu</span> layered on next. It is good to do it.</p>
