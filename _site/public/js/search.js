Then pour it through a coarse canvas or tammy cloth so that it falls into the strongest vinegar you can find, because the vinegar makes it strong and makes it less brittle. Repeat this two or three times and it will be fine and well purified.

And stir continuously over a charcoal fire until the sandarac is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said varnish on a plate and, if it is fat enough when you handle it with a finger, it is ready. And for one pound of lavender spike oil, you should put five ounces of ground sandarac.  Some only put in four ounces but this is not as good, nor as fat. The former dries promptly. To avoid the trouble of polishing their ebony, framemakers varnish it with this. So do guitarmakers. This varnish is not as fitting for paintings as fine turpentine varnish, though it is good for the paintings’ moldings. When linseed varnish was in use, one would not commonly varnish the landscape of a painting because it would turn the landscape yellow. But with turpentine varnish one varnishes everywhere. Instead of sandarac, you can add to it pulverized mastic drop by drop or otherwise, and it will dry more quickly.  If you want to varnish plaster or a wall, first put on your colle de retaille, very hot, because if cold it would not penetrate the wall at all. And when you would have put your varnish on, it would come off.\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 004r\n\n  Aspic oil varnish is not as apt for colors as that of turpentine, because aspic oil eats the colors, since it is too penetrating.\n\n\n",

If you put the mirror at the far end of a table with a candle on it, it will reflect two lights on the table for you.

Then turn the concave face of the mirror towards the hole, and anyone passing by in the street will be reflected on the sheet of paper. Do the same with the pierced door of a closed room. You can make wavy mirrors and triangular ones, such as are described by Ptolemy and Archimedes. The concave sort can also set fire to straw or light a candle from afar, using the sun.

Therefore, for burnished gold take good chalk, quite white, well ground and soaked with distemper glue and do four coats of it, one after the other, on the wood. And when the last one is dry, rub it with prêle, which is a kind of grass otherwise named horsetail, to render it well polished. Afterwards, take fine Armenian bole and sanguine, as much of one as of the other, a bit of lamb tallow the size of a bean or a pea depending on the quantity of bole, and a little willow charcoal, or as much as the tallow, and half a walnut shell filled with half—burned saffron; some put in a little candi sugar. Grind everything together with water and apply it without gum or glue, and let it dry.

Then, with  the oil thus made fatty, grind a little white lead, massicot and black graphite, at discretion, as much of one as of the other. Minium will color the gold. Then apply an even layer of that onto your stamp, taking care you do not fill the hollows. And once it is almost dry, apply the gold leaf on it using cotton. Such gold will withstand rain on houses or elsewhere. And if you have made your gilt with tinsel, color it with smoke from a partridge or from yellow or red cloth, and it will look as fine as pure gold. You can cover trunks, mirrors, bed valances and posts in colored velvet or satin and then apply the gilded stamped ornament on them with strong glue.\n\n",

Some take the most delicate they can &amp; crush it with ceruse, which binds it, and next prick with an awl in several places the area they want to paint with azur d’esmail, such that the oil enters &amp; leaks in, &amp; does not cause the azure, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the panel flat &amp; apply the azure on it, which is also done à destrempe. The main thing is to crush it well on marble, and before that, to have washed it thoroughly. Some grind it with thoroughly with an egg yolk &amp; then wash it in five or six lots of water and lay it on not with a painceau, which would be too soft, but with a broisse highly softened &amp; bent, &amp; laying it on thickly as if one were applying it with a trowel; settling down it evens out and flattens. I have experienced that crushing azur d’esmail with egg yolk &amp; then washing it in several lots of water is good, although it loses a little of its vividness in the crushing of it. I have also washed it in several lots of water &amp;, when it had settled a little, I removed the water, still q blue, with a sponge and squeezed it into another vessel thus where it settled, &amp; from the residue I had the ash, flower and subtlest part of the azure without crushing it, which is the best, for in the crushing of it, it loses some of its color. Those who make it in Germany compose it like enamel, in large pieces which they pestle, &amp; pass through several sieves &amp; wash.\n\nTo make azures beautiful, they wash or soak them in a rock water, as they call it; it is a water distilled from mines where azure or vert d’azur is found, which distills naturally through the mountain’s veins or is distilled with an alembic par from &gt;mineral stones of azure or copper.\n\nAzure ashes are only good for landscapes because they die in oil. Only true azure lasts. Azur d’esmail cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on the fingernail or the oil palette. If it happens to be sandy, do not crush it except with the egg yolk or, better yet, wash it in clear water &amp; with a sponge remove the colored water after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner you will extract the quite delicate flower, which will be easy to work with.\n\n",

It is necessary to strip what you want to engrave on a lead wheel or with a stone or with glass, because the polishing is like varnish or glass and stops the diamond or sapphire from engraving well.

  content: "- - - - - 012v - - - - - \n \n\nTo whiten enilanroc\n\nSome believe the ceruse—color crust that is on top to be natural. Others say that it is a lost secret of ancient lapidaries. Others say that it is enamel that has been reheated. And, from this crust, one can form multiple ciphers, letters, circles and other bizarre motifs. As to the means, I proceeded thus: I once wanted to add a layer of arsenic ground on marble. However, I did the experiment without it, and I put the above mentioned thing, enilanroc, in a small iron casket on the fire of my goldsmith’s forge with three or four small half—burnt coals and blew on it only with my mouth. However, the thing caught fire and became all white, not only on its surface but also inside. And then I let it cool on its own near the fire, since otherwise, exposing it suddenly to cold air, it would have cracked. While it was all white, I passed it through my lead wheel and I found it to be as hard as it was before. And after scraping off a little of the white, I found it to be of a clear fleshy tone. Finally, I polished it and observed that it took quite a beautiful polish luster and that it could compare with a quite beautiful agate for the purpose of engraving it with some beautiful face and applying it to a table of\n- - - - - 013r - - - - - \nagate of various colors. But because this overall whiteness did not correspond with the white crust on the surface that I was seeking, leaving the rest of the thing its natural color, I made a hole in a brick, precisely the same size as the object, and put it inside. Then I heated two glassmaker’s soldering irons until they became red hot and, when they were red hot, I applied them one after the other onto the surface of the object until I got the white crust I was looking for, on which I made the drawing that I wanted, revealing the red background, with a diamond point, and I polished it with hog bristles and tripoli. I don’t know if it would be better to reheat it under hot ashes, and if it would be good to encase it in alabaster, which is quite cold, as I did in the brick.\n\n",

Therefore, in places where stones and bricks are lacking, one can use earth to make walls thin and thick. The best for this is light earth, which does not form clumps when plowed, or better, that which in some way mingled with arene, because it can be most easily beaten and tamped down. It is true that it needs to be dampened and cut into clumps with a ditch—spade, and put and placed in this form. This one lasts more and does not require that much effort, and dryness doesn’t make it split or crack. However, since such kinds of earth are not found everywhere, those who live on good and fertile land, after drawing the width and length of their foundations with a rope, drive in long poles and rafters along the edges on each side to support boards between which they throw the earth, making each layer about one foot thick, interspersed with S.S.S—shaped branches of heather or similar things, then they tamp it down and beat it with beaters of three different forms. One is called the mall, which has a triangular form like A, and this is used firstly to tamp down the earth. Then one uses another made of pointed woodblocks fitted onto a thick stick, and this one is used to properly press the earth at the wall’s ends and edges where they adhere to the boards, and is called [blank]. The other one is called the bat and is used to flatten and beat the earth for the last time, as shown in C. Then one makes another layer of earth and heather and beats as has been said, and continues thus until completing the wall, which is covered with heather and then with earth. Some intersperse the said wall with rows of bricks. They also make walls with a sloped foot, adding width to the foundations according to how high they want to build the wall. When it is old it whitens, showing that it has saltpeter in it. Which is why, when they fall down, gunpowder makers profit from them.\n\n\n  Figure\nat left bottom margin of folio 014r\n\n\n\n",

This is clearly shown [by] a arquebus with a chamber which recoils more than another. And since the cannon is bigger at the breech than at the muzzle the sights are also uneven, because that at the breech is higher than that at the muzzle. Additionally, the thickness of the cannon is greater than the caliber by about one line, and the sight by another. It would therefore be necessary to either make the cannon all of one size or to raise the barrel from the end and towards the muzzle, and push it in and lower towards the breech.

Then look in the barrel along the string, and if it does not touch equally all over, note the place where it does not touch and hit it with a hammer on the exterior of this this side in the same place, and this will make it straight. Do this all around it.\n\n",

Pewterers cast the sour as grills to sell it better. They go better and more cleanly in stone moulds than in copper molds because copper is fat and draws the mild tin when heated.

But because such a daily fayre would be too expensive for them, they are usually fed with hemp—seed. The owsell is purged with a spider, which you must give it once a week, so that it doesn’t become too strong. The lark is purged with dry mortar, composed of lime and sand, to keep it from becoming too strong and fat. Small young birds are purged with the same dry mortar, by placing small lumps of it in their cages. The cuckoo lays its eggs in the nest of the bunting, otherwise know as verdaule. This bird is very simple—minded, I have previously let two go, which after a few days returned to their cage.

  content: "- - - - - 051r - - - - - \n\nCutters of printing plates\n\nTo clean the copper plates or to have used ones print better, boil them for four or five hours in a good detergent with quite used laundry water. Then make your ink with some linseed oil instead of walnut oil and press with the rollers. The copper plates are ready sooner than the wood ones, but they are not so clean to print promptly. The wood ones are tedious but would have sooner printed twenty sheets against two [sheets] of the other. To print with wood, the secret is firstly to poach, that is to say to lay the transferred pattern or drawn piece down on the wood plank and to make sure that the drawn side is stuck to the wood. Once dry, you will gently rub with a moist handkerchief the reverse side of the paper which, by being rubbed, will become so fine that what will remain will almost only be the drawn part, which, after, one should trace while cutting the pattern. You could do that to ornamented glass and glass layered with black cut pieces, to then scrape and layer your colors on the uncovered [side]. To make ink for copper plates\n- - - - - 051v - - - - - \nwhich is different from the printers’ one, you have to boil for a long time some walnut oil or, even better, some linseed oil, and after boiling for a long time, you will add garlic cloves and bread crusts to skim them and leave again to boil on big fire, then eventually you will add a measure of lampblack that you would have ground with some oil previously on the marble. And lastly you will mix everything and until you see that the plate prints well. And when you will have spread the ink, dry the plate with a white sheet of paper and do that until the paper looks clean and then print. If you dry the plates with a cloth, it would remove the ink off. Linseed oil gets thicker while boiling and becomes similar to a varnish and risks catching fire as soon as you boil it, so make sure that when you boil it, it is in an open space or where the flame cannot damage anything. Some burn some scale until it turns black and grind it with some non—boiled linseed oil or walnut oil that some consider to be better. This black is beautiful but the lamp smoke one is blacker. When you want to print, take with your finger’s end and reasonably spread some of the said black all over the plate previously cleaned with some detergent as said, then, rub it with a white sheet of paper until the paper is completely white and do not touch it with your bare hand but with a paper applied on it. And after cleaning the plate perfectly, rub again the sides and edges with a folded sheet of paper. Then, have [available] a small even table and on it a piece of felt, then a few sheets of paper and eventually the one you want to print on, moistened between two humid napkins. And on this sheet of paper, put your sheet then some more paper, and at least another piece of felt. Then put it through the rollers and you can print a dozen pieces consecutively while always charging the plate with ink and cleaning it as you did. But if you stop printing, the rest of the ink will dry out in the plate’s lines and so you will have to let it boil in detergent or urine, as said, to clean it. The rollers must not be too loose.\n\n",

Let it drink water from a good fountain or river water. I do not know if it would be good sometimes to let him drink the water of sulfur springs, and to sometimes give him fenugreek or other hot foods, for the intention of the worker is to use the heat of his manure, and the climate here is cooler than that of Algiers. Keep it in a warm place and use it and make sure it loses none of its manure or urine, of which you will make a mass or two so that while one cools the other will keep its heat and be suitable to continue. Also have a large flask as thick as possible, one finger thick if it can be so made, and with a capacity of one pitcher or clay jug, and around the feast of St John place a dozen and a half chicken eggs, that is to say, the egg without the egg white and the germ. Others say sixty yolks. And with this dozen and a half of chicken egg yolks put one half ounce (others say sixty eggs and a half pound) of female silk worm eggs. And after carefully luting the flask (I do not know if air will be needed for the generation) and bury it in the heat of the manure up to the neck, and leave it there until several worms are engendered and then remove the flask and do not bury it in the manure anymore. But put it on the hot layer of the manure until all the worms are eaten and consume one another by shriveling and stirring, and only one remains. Once this has happened, you must lure it at regular intervals, day and night, with the assistance of two men, who will care for it in shifts, and you will lure it with an egg yolk covered in gold leaf or with a liquid yolk into which the gold leaf has been incorporated. And be careful that it does not miss such fodder (some say one egg yolk per hour, others say three, but the thing itself will demonstrate the practice). So nourished in this way it will grow in two month or seven weeks and will become like a serpent, one span and four fingers long, and one pound in weight, and as the wings will begin to develop, you must kill it, doing so with a charcoal fire in a ring around the bottle one span away from it, and at that time lute the bottle well so that it does not exhale.\n- - - - - 052v - - - - - \nor to be safer, go away until the fire is completely blown out and that everything is cold again. Because the exaltation may be dangerous. And for that moment, when you take it with some tongs, do cover your mouth with some good vinegar and have a protection and cover yourself with it. Once it has died out, put it into a cloth or a canvas made of silk and fold it and hold it to a board exposed to air and the sun will dry it. Once it is well dry, powder it in a mortar and keep this powder cautiously Because one ounce of this one thrown on 3 pounds of melted ♁ transforms it into a finer ☉ than the other one. But there is not so much pitch. You also have to choose the oldest ♁ possible which has often melted before and finely hammered into blades or other works, and at first purify it by melting and throwing it into some honey and vinegar. The completion time for such work is nine months from Saint John’s day until the 25th April.\n\n",

The one from Spain brought by merchants is considered to be the best, because the worms coming from it are not so subject to illnesses and produce more silk. In Spain, one ounce of grain gives worms that commonly make 15 lb. of silk. But from one once produced in France, they do not make but 10 or 12. Three ounces of grain are to produce such a quantity of worms, with which you will be able to furnish a room with three or 4 shelves of wide boards. They begin to shed their skin on their own around Easter. And to do this, one has to put them in a pine box, like the ones in which we put pellet, warmly among feather cushions. And in the beginning, they shed their skin as little black ants, and as soon as there are two or three without skin, they have to be given white mulberry leaves. And then arrange them on the boards. And three times per day, it is necessary to change the leaves for fresh ones. And if during the day there is any storm or rainy weather, cloudy and cool, one needs to keep in the room three or 4 embers and with glowing coal, and to light incense until the room is filled with its smoke. And when the weather is warm and serene, they produce more and better silk. Some worms make it whiter, others more yellowish. And even if it is white, it can be yellowed when it is extracted with hot water. From their birth until the moment they make their cocoons and prisons, worms sleep and rest 4 times, and each time they remain 4 or five days resting without eating, as if they were dying so as to be born again, because each one sheds their skin and begins by uncovering the head, then consequently, on different days, the rest of the body, and they go from white to grey, and from grey to white. And if one of them has some sickness and does not have the strength to shed, one needs to help it and to be careful not to squash it, because if it gives off a yellow liquor, it is no longer worth anything. And they do not even serve much if one handles them. Around Pentecost, they begin to want to climb on the dry heather branches that we prepare and attach.\n- - - - - 054r - - - - - \nto some of the upper boards, and one can tell when they want to climb up when, on the leaf, they stretch out and raise their heads and a part of their bodies when one takes them to heather branches where they stop and begin to spin their prison, which we call cocoon, generally the size of a pigeon egg, although there are some which are much bigger because it sometimes happens that two or three and up to 11 worms put themselves in a cocoon, which is hairy and cottony, around which ball is filoselle or floret, and of the cocoon, which is a white, solid, continuous and firm skin, silk is made. The cocoon is so hard that it is cut with difficulty with a fingernail. And yet to leave its prison, the worm eats away at it on one end, and after having stayed inside, living on its own juices for three weeks, it comes out, reduced in size by half. Because when it begins to spin, it is as long as a ring finger and has eight legs, and when it comes out it is less than half as long and only has four legs. On the other hand, it has become a butterfly and has wings; however, it does not fly. There are males and females. As soon as they come out of the cocoon, the male mates with the female, and they are put on a piece of white linen where they lay their eggs, which will not be good and viable if the male was not given to her. When the male has detached himself from a female, one must get rid of it because it would not be good to give it to another female. They finish spinning and laying eggs in three weeks and around Saint John’s Day. And then one keeps their eggs and grain until Holy Week, as mentioned. Some [worms] spin among the leaves and make their cocoons there without climbing high.\n\n",

To make a beautiful flesh color, the reddest and brightest lake is the best, because those that are purple and violet as a result of the addition of too much alum look like the flesh of someone that is very cold. That is why women who want to color their cheeks crush Florence lake very finely, then fill a little cotton with it, which they then wrap in a little fine cambric. And thus they rub the lake on their cheeks and then, with another clean cotton, they soften it.\n\nCrystallin having been crushed in water appears to have body, but in oil it does not have any. It is crushed with lake and with bitumen, which would not dry for a very long time otherwise.\n\nAspic oil is commonly put with lead white, not entirely pure but mixed with a little walnut oil. The said aspic oil will not be good for lake and colors that do not have body because it will make them crack, but with those that have body and are somewhat greasy, it is quite appropriate.\n\nVerdigris and orpiment must be first crushed with urine rather than thinned with oil. Thus they are beautiful and do not fade.\n\n",

And if you cannot find any that is fine enough, you may as well grind it, not with water but with oil, and grind it thick. Then lay it on your palette and mix in some turpentine but not much, to make it bind, and make it as thick as butter or mortar, and then, with a large enough brush, work it while always moving the brush freely. Then, to soften it, make jagged hatching movements with the tip of the brush. The highlights will be made using the same diluted with ceruse, which makes it bind, making it easier to work. I have seen it used thus. It must be very thick, so that you almost need an effort to spread it with your brush. And it will be all the better if you lay down your painting. All these difficulties do not occur when it is very fine and fluid without being crushed, and it doesn’t run. \n. \nAzure needs to be applied neatly, which is why it always fades when it is applied over old, already tarnished, azure to mend an old painting. In such cases, it is better to scrape off the old layer and prime again and then apply the azure. It is the same for almost all other colors. Also azure mixed with oil always remains shiny, which is not good for azure because that makes it fade.\n\n\n  at left bottom margin of folio 061v\n\n  \n\n\n",

Let the tip of the charcoal be sharp, and to prevent if from quickly becoming dulled and blunt, drag the tip flat, thus you will constantly sharpen it. Hold your charcoal as far as possible, and accustom yourself to drawing with a light touch. Because if you become accustomed to drawing delicately with charcoal, you shall do the same with colors. And whoever is rough with charcoal is never exquisite with colors. And by a line of charcoal, masters assess their apprentices. First make the contour of your drawing, that is the outline, lightly and without too diligent work, rather with boldness. By so doing, you will learn to be an artist, and if you need to erase anything, you will not waste as much time as if you had elaborated it. Afterwards work on all the details, not standing too close to your panel, but sometimes stepping back in order to better assess the proportions. Once you are satisfied with the first drawing, retrace all the lines with your paintbrush in pink or another gummed or distempered color.

However, these things would not otherwise lose their coat or become hollow if they are mixed or include glass tin in them, just like they mix a little glass tin in the soft tin. They carve their work on stones of which the sharpening stones or barber’s files are made. These are found in great flakes near the mountains, and resemble slate. They are found in three colors: one reddish, that is not as perfect as the others because it does not sustain heat ; another one is the color of dark slate, and the other is whitish. When they work a relief, first they print it on carton, which is one finger thick, to serve as a pattern. After planing their stones and rubbing them together , they use a compass or little iron tools to carve their figures. They make their molds with three or four stones, to make a circle or a square with the stones which join perfectly because the stones are of equal size. Before casting, they rub the mould over with tallow, and it the mould absorbs it quickly because it is hot. Then, having put fine powder of quicklime into a cloth, they rub the mould using pounce in beating the linen on top, then blow it a little on top; this prevents bubbles from forming. The main thing is to make some vents. If the work is big, they do as it is shown on the picture. They make a hole in the medal, somewhere where it is least visible, and with a bit they pierce the mold on the side of the medal.\n\n\n  Figure\n\n\n\nAnd if they want their work to last, they pierce it somewhere and fit in a piece of cork.

And on the center of the wheel there is a flat line or an alidade which points to the number on the circle that you want to mark on your wheel. Then with a point, they draw a line on the wheel. Then they return the alidade to the following point, and they thus go on marking it the dial.

All fine latten molds cleaner than red copper. If you want to cast something fragile and tenuous, the secret is casting as hot as possible so that the matter boils. You will know that it is hot enough when it smokes a lot and stirring it makes sparks. For heating well you should place your crucible as low as possible, close to the forging mill, so that the bellows blow on the middle of the crucible, thus it heats better than on the grate on which we usually put the crucible, under which the bellows blow. It is true that the crucible can easily break but you can lute it as you know founders do. You need to keep feeding the fire with coals, which are between the bellows and the crucible. Make sure to cast all at once and not in increments or drop by drop, otherwise the conduit will be plugged by the matter. It is better to make an abreveoir to abreuver the medal. It is necessary that you stir the melted matter with a stick, so that the matter at the bottom heats well. Because Iron turns the matter acid.

Then cast and if there is not enough thickness press a bit and force the figure down into the box mold.\n\nIt is wise to always mold the faces not close to the cast but the head in bottom because the strength of the material concentrates at the entry of the medal and where the force of the impurity is. Thus if you molded the face close to the cast in this manner, you could find impurities there. It is better that impurities remain on the clothes which you can repair more easily\n\nVinegar is better for moistening than wine. It is necessary that the box mold be quite equal, otherwise as you press one side, it lifts up the opposite one.\n\nThis is why the press is better because it tightens more extremely than by hand, and makes\n\nthe sand become fat which loses its moisture. With soft and fine sand which is powdered, and dry, burnish the medal.\n\nWhen you mold, always leaves your medal in one of the box molds without stirring it because if your pipe is not clean, it will not mold well. You can repair it thanks to the bolts which prevent it from moving. But first, burnish your medal with charcoal made from willow. Then clean your medal because that degreases it and makes it easier to remove it from the mold afterwards.\n\nDo not knock as you are molding because that damage the box mold and the sand.\n\n",

I left it to dry for a while to reduce it to a powder and mold it with sand, it having been ground into small pieces with my fingers and the sharp side of a knife. I oiled my medal because oil cleans it without damaging it. And after cleaning and drying the medal with a cloth and small bristle brush of pork skin, I lightly oiled it once more with clear walnut oil, and gently swiped it with a cloth so that [the medal] would not be too oiled; having already considered that in this way [the medal] should come out easily, because the white lead, wet with glair, which would not damage the oil. This worked very well. I molded a medal very cleanly in high relief, without it having any lumps, which a lot of good sands such as felt, burnt bone, and iron dross failed to do on the first attempt. I re—cooked it and my mold became hard like marble. And then I knew that sands used to mold big relief must be very moist with some kind of water, which gives body and firmness, like egg white, gummed water, [or] one [water] boiled with elm root. And lightly oil your medal. It can take as many firings as you want because it is as hard as glass. But soft lead and sour tin must be cast at a very hot temperature.    Since that moment, I have realized that even though this sand is excellent, can be cast often and molds very neatly, it is fat and it makes bubbles. In this way, the soft lead does not suit the mold well. But I have tried to mix it with lean sand, such as pumice, metal scrapings, and similar things, in order to give it body, and to help it come off easily, because lean sand [alone] does not come off easily; and yet it takes metal well.    Try to mix white lead or minium with other sands.   X    Oil and smear with aspic oil, which will disappear when reheated, because the oil causes bubbling.    It is necessary to mold with egg white, and then mix it well. And once it is in the box mold, beat it well on the top with a pestle, or something else clean. This helps to make molding better and come out more easily.    It is best to fill the box mold in one go, because the mixture made of several sands, and the one from mines, that you use to fill the box mold, damages it.\n",

It came out with a quite neat relief on one side &amp; hollow on the other, as much the figure as the letters. It is true that the material was whitish, as though it were metallic, but this was because of the potin. I made another cast with frying pan material, alone in the same sand, but not as reheated. It did not come out well.\n\nThen I molded burned bull’s foot bone, pulverized &amp; strained through a double sieve, and wet with egg white or wine boiled with the root of an elm. I lightly knocked on top of it while molding. While opening the box frame, I found that the figures had come out not at all clean &amp; it left the molds as though they were floury &amp; crumbling. I wet the bone sand more so that it held together well between the figures, and in this way I molded neatly with good come—away. And even though it seemed like the ground bone was lumpy, when casting with frying pan material, it turned out that my figures were quite clean.

Then let it firm up on its own for a few days if you have the leisure for it. And afterwards let it really heat up again, not instantly nor with a large fire, but little by little, otherwise it will crumble &amp; always have some defects.

Above all it the sand must be lumped together much like a precious stone or a stone, and the deeper in the earth one gets it from, the better. The signs of its quality is that it is thus gathered together, that, if the stone is removed as it should be i.e. in the correct way, it forms pieces and lumps together, which demonstrates its capacity for binding, and that it the sand is not too dry. However, it should crumble in your hands. And the grain must be quite small, fine, and homogeneous. If this sand is not fine enough, you can filter it and grind it up finely either with water, or through a sieve, when it or on the porphyry. That way it loses its dryness and becomes greasy and well bound. You can mold it in a box mold or in a noyau without wadding, and try it with lead because, if it does not swell and casts neatly, it will bear out well too. Some say that fatty sands do not work for casting metal that is too hot. Artisans who undertake a big job and who want to save money do not need to crush sand and seek the curious properties of artificial sand; they have more to profit from finding natural sand that has the finest grain possible. And for a small job, they take advantage of finding the finest natural sand they can. For a smaller job, they only filter the sand through the sieve. But those who work on a very small scale crush the sand and grind it finely until it becomes impalpable, because they do not need as much sand.\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 088v\n\n  Ground wheat makes a tawny—colored powder that is quite fine and quite soft.

For tin, I believe that it is not necessary to look further to find a material that takes to powder better, and even for use with fine lead which has almost better results than tinTou. The bone of an ox hoof is always dry, that is why you must mix it with fatty sand, so it will bind like tripoli, salts, felt, ashes and similar materials.

It should be humidified in a cellar or in the cool humid evening air, or to have it quickly, in a sheet of paper in a moist towel. Take care not to leave it too long because it will soften, which would not be good if you wanted to use it as a box mold.

If you want to mold a core, rub your medal with aspic oil. It is better to use 4 ounces of ammonia salt per pound. Humidify it in a damp place for two or three days, so that the material can be handled without sticking. You will mold very cleanly. Let the mold dry out and reheat it, that way it will get body, and become as hard as stone and when it is like that it is far easier to remove from the mold.

From deep in the sandpit, one can find some lumps and gravel that show the sand’s natural compaction; it is quite hard to break, with very small and fine grains, quite smooth between the fingers. And since it is found solely close to mountainous regions or arid lands, you cannot find any near every good town, where artisans live. Thus, if they can’t find any close to their home, they prefer to order some of this sand from afar, like Lyon, Venice or Paris, near the Sainte Chapelle, and similar areas, instead of preparing it themselves. Nonetheless, you can be assured that in all locations, you can make sand from the sandpit and will be good and will mold cleanly. Because the sand is coarse and dry, filter it through a sieve. If it is not fine enough, wash it. And when the water has settled a little, pour the soiled water into another pot. The coarse [grains] will quickly fall to the bottom of the first pot. But the sand from the troubled water pot, having settled, will be much finer. If this sand does not bind enough, dry crush it on the porphyry, thus making it impalpable, and it will bind as chalk does. If you wish you can reheat it, and straight after crush it and blend it with salts, or burned cloth, or felt, or paper ashes, or similar material.\n\n",

Every two year they remember to open the sides of the planters and meticulously cut and trim the ends of the orange tree’s roots, which are dry. Otherwise, the roots find the wood [of the planter] and tighten on it, they double over themselves, the ends dry and the tree dies. Once trimmed, the roots gain new space to expand, without encountering resistance from the wood of the planter. That is why it is better to join the sides of the planter with screws rather than nails, to avoid shaking the soil when one opens them.\n\n",

If the pith is damaged, the graft will take in an unstraight manner, like with vines of all peach and apricot trees. Apricot trees have a very thin bark, and so it is necessary to graft them onto young trees whose own bark is not thick yet, such as the young shoots of prune trees or apricot trees. The graft will not take if the cutting gets wet. It is necessary therefore to graft in serein and mild weather, not too cold and not too windy. One must use old wood to graft, if one wants to graft on a tree that is already mature and quite big; because if this is the case, it will compress the cutting, and if the cutting is of young wood, it will not grow properly. But old wood resists the compression of old wood better than the young, because it is harder than young wood.

If you have a small medal, divide the bone into two pieces, then smooth the two parts with a knife. And on a dry, smooth rooftile [that has been] pulverized with willow charcoal, rub and polish the two half bones. In this way, the bones soak up the willow charcoal so that the bones will come off cleanly from the cast, and will not stick to it. Then on a fake bone, that is to say a bit of smooth brick of the same width as your bone, place your medal. And then on the medal, put your bone and press it firmly with another stone of the same size. And for a second time, mold it, and instead smooth over the top with willow charcoal and blow slowly, then press as before, and it will cast neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, two whole bones are needed. Any work that is cast is brittle and prone to breaking, because the metal swells when cast, and contracts and condenses when hammered. That is why it is necessary to retrace with a chisel the cast object and in this way the metal will contract again and let it escrouir. If the piece you have to cast is in high relief, first trace the mold and the hollow with a penknife, to make a clear path for the medal and then cast it. And if the medal has two sides\n\n\n  at left bottom margin of folio 091r\n\n  Rather than casting, heat the bones only to make them lose the coldness and wetness.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom margin of folio 091r\n\n  When the lead gets too hot, it calcinates.\n\n- - - - - 091v - - - - - \nBecause the two bones are joined, cut around them with precision, and make notches in different places which cross through where the two bones are joined, so as to recognize the place where they were first joined. Or with little shards of wood, you can also pierce the bones, or coat the joints with clay, and leave it to dry. Compress between them it with your two hands in between your knees; and do not use a normal press, otherwise the bones will break. Mold at your leisure two or three times, until you can see that it has the design come up and is well imprinted. And on each occasion rather than putting the piece straight back in the mold, smooth with willow charcoal because it helps it to come out easily. Once you have cast, rub your medal with oil and willow charcoal with a brush, to make it dull. Take care that your medal is not greasy or oily when you cast it in cuttlefish bone. Once you have cast, leave it to cool rather than taking the medal out straight away, because when one takes it out hot, some bone will come away with the medal. Cast at medium heat, which you will recognize because the bone should stay almost white. But when it is too hot, the bone becomes brown. The proportion of lead and tin is equal, one to the other. If the piece is difficult to cast, and composed of various pieces, cast it with a forked pattern, of three or four grooves, and make and make these grooves where the metal is the thickest. Also make these grooves around the medal and directly on the head because this attracts the metal and will fill the figure best. Lift your boxmold a little, once you cast, and in this way you will be able to make several clean casts. Tin that is too hot burns the bone which becomes damaged. Moreover, having come out of the mold hot , it risks breaking. \n&gt; Figure\n&gt; \n\n",

Then, with a small pinceau, one makes the shadows, which won’t come off. Next, one lays the flesh tones, which do not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And then, one retouches the more prominent areas with lively flesh tones. And with another pinceau one retouches the shadows in hatching. The shadow strokes do not come off because they are made of bister, which stains the canvas like rust. The said bister is good for making shadows with distemper, for in oil it has no body and would dry with great difficulty. One mixes ru ochre in the said bister for shadows with a little sap green. The best bister is the rich, shiny one from the fireplaces of large kitchens. It is difficult to grind and screeches on the marble slab.\n\n",

  content: "- - - - - 094r - - - - - \n\nBurnisher\n\nThe different parts of a sword are the handle, [and] the sheath of the sword. What comes next is the heel. The rest is the blade. The sides are the edge and the point. Certain blades, acute in point, have only one side filed in the middle &amp; along the whole length, and are easy to break. Other blades are called of three molds or three grips, which have one good rise in the middle, but this elevation is flat as if it were acute in point but flattened. These ones are most certain. Others are called fluted, which are notched from the middle, &amp; when it is along the whole length, they are just as easy to break as those acute in point and are more troublesome to burnish because the burnishing stick can’t get in. But they make one specially that is narrow. Making up the hilt of the sword are the pommel, the branches of the hilt and the cross—guard, which is this iron strip that closes off the guard [and] that is at the end of the heel to stop thrusts from sliding down the hilt. The rings are these two branches in half round that start from the eye of the guard and go all the way to the branch of the cross—guard. The branch that crosses the hilt is called the body and this escutcheon, by which the sword enters the sheath and to which all the branches return, and which holds them, is called the eye of the guard. Following is the wood of the grip which one glues or more fittingly [uses] some mingled wax which is made of wax and pitch, for rosin would be too hard. He heats it lightly, then rubs the wood of the grip so that the tang takes hold, or the threads, otherwise, when a thread frays off, the whole thing will break all at once. With iron thread or dog skin, one also uses glue. The trimming set on the wood, which is made of silk or thread, is called the cord, which is made from two or three threads twined on the spinning wheel, or 4 if the silk is thin. A cord a little bigger holds better. The rivements, which are also made of silk at both ends of the grip, are called the buttons. Some grips are made of silk, seal skin, iron thread reheated with gold and fine and false silver thread &amp; velvet [thread]. Iron thread is of less price and is most durable. Next is that of silk, if one does not have the convenience of being close to the sea in order to recover some dog skin, which is quite convenient. The good skin costs fifty or lx s{ous} and makes 4 or five dozen grips. This one gives a good grip and a sure hand. To put it to work, if it is too hard, soak it for one or two hours in slightly lukewarm aqua fortis. Because if it were too hot, it would boil and spoil the skin. It is sewn with black thread.\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 094r\n\n  Figure\n\n\n\n- - - - - 094v - - - - - \nThe gold handles are made with some yellow thin cloth set below or other kind of chalk—yellowed fabric. And this cloth is set on with glue or aforesaid gum. This is in order to make the thread hold better on it. These latter are made of cordons like the silk ones and between two cordons are put one or two threads to enhance it. The silver one is identically made. And there is as much difficulty as for the silk one, not because silk is difficult to twisted, but it needs to be twisted twice. A fine gold handle is worth 28 or 20 cents. The best sword point is of sage foliage. This long stick on which the sword is laid down and attached in order to furbish is called the chameau. It is commonly made from rowan which is hard and even. The stick underneath which is folded bow—like is called the arch. The stick above is called stick of the fustÃ©e. And this square piece, used on the sword to burnish it, is called the fustÃ©e. There are two horns, one is called the oil hornet and the other the emery hornet. There is an iron tool with the shape of a halberd point, square and made of very even and well limed steel called the grateau which helps to soften lime strokes on swords hilts and to sharpen blades once they are softened which is better than with stone or other tools which leave some scratches. To make the swords cut better, the edge from the point is also sharpened. Those who create sword hilts are different craftsmen than furbishers. The fustÃ©e is a three—finger—thick, square wood tool, made of boxwood which fit in the middle of the fustÃ©e stick to furbish. The fresil stick is made of willow wood which is to [â€¦] weapon with some clinker which is the iron scale falling from the blacksmiths’ forge.\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 094v\n\n  Figure\n\n le banc des fourreaux\n\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 094v\n\n  Figure\n\n\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 094v\n\n  a b D le baston a felinder c le flin ou pierre de fouldre\n\n- - - - - 095r - - - - - \nThe furbisher buys his blades by the dozen which are not finished, [but ready] to be pulled from [their] sheaths since he does this himself in order to add them well at the pommels and guards. Spanish swords are esteemed to be better for they are of better steel and iron but they are not as well—forged as Vienna swords, in DauphinÃ©. The Spanish ones are not as well sharpened from the forge since they sharpen them with their feet and this is what makes them wavy. Vienna blades cost commonly Xviii or 19 lb. The first thing the furbisher does to his new blades is to draw them out from the sheath, which he does himself or has it done by locksmiths or blacksmiths to whom he gives some liart for their charcoal. Afterwards they pass it over a grindstone to cut it down. Then they lay it down on the chameau, and with some powdered emery, fine and soft as flour, and soaked with oil to make it take, they polish the sword with the stick used to take off the tracks left by the grindstone and then they clean the blade well with the emery. And they add a drop or two of oil spread with the finger to give it luster. Once the oil is applied, they polish it again on the chameau with the “felin” which is a thunderstone mounted on the middle of a stick like the “fustÃ©e.” And this stick is called the “felindel” stick. Once they used the “felin,” they polish it again with some chalk and the oil [already] on the sword. After they follow this and going over it again, they polish it with dry chalk. Finally when they are finished with mounting [of the pommel and guard], they give it a sharp edge with a file. They then dry it and sharpen it and furbish it again with some dry chalk. At the end when they are completed and mounted, they give it [the blade] a sharp edge with a grater. They are polished on a false mounting with the guards which are present in order to find out if they work well together. And employing a blade of the sort of which all the sizes should be made in the hand, one conjectures whether it will be as strong when mounted. One puts the blade in a vice between two pieces of wood, then with a file, they enlarge [it] if needed for attaching the guard. Then to clench it, one positions the place to be riveted and the pommel on a piece of wood. And with a hammer, one beats on the top to make it very level and to secure the pommel. Then with the hammer, one finishes the rivet when the hammer is well secured and does not shake. The wood is placed so as not to put gashes in the pommel. Afterwards one makes a place for the rivet with a file or chisel. And some make the rivet [or attachment] in a diamond—shape but this is not as good as a round [topped one] because one cuts oneself on the corner of the rivet.\n- - - - - 095v - - - - - \nThe end can be bought already made, a dozen of small ones costs six sols but the big ones 2 carolii.The end is fixed either with nails which are fixed on the sides of the cutting edge, but this only spoils the sword and rots the scabbard for the water goes into it via the juncture of the nail. The best way is to apply some resin or glue but the resin is better. And the best is when the end is tightly set and so hot when set that powdered resin on the end melts, in that way it doesn’t fall and can’t be undone unless it is put in fire. Hilts are of different types: Ornate Guttered which is with round mouldings Pearled Scarfed when the bands are crosswise Onioned which is with a flat head In the King’s manner, fully covered The furbishers buy them by dozens, the dozen of full ones costs 10 lb. the worked one, 30 sols or [more] depending on its nature. The first thing that the apprentice does is to furbish as said. And then to adorn the sword and make a scabbard which is the summum of the art. They buy scabbards’ wood pieces which are wholly made of beech wood, a hundred for 15 or 20 or 30 sols, depending on how far they are made. Theses wood pieces are thus called estelles, and have to be very clean and without any knots and are one finger thick. Then the furbisher puts them on a small bench, called a scabbard bench and with a small iron tool similar to the joiners’ bench, they maintain it firmly. Then with a plane, which is like a two—handled knife, they work the wood piece from the top, then use the joyner’s plane to flatten it more. Afterwards, the inside is scoured with a\n\n",

And cut off a branch in which you can see that beside the place where the leaves join the stem, there are little buttons we call buds, the initial stages of a sprout. With dexterity you must, with a very sharp pen—knife, cut in the shape of a graft a small bit of the skin of the tree, which contains a bud or a sprout with the leaf, as you can see in B. Then on the tender wood, which is full of sap, and on which you wish to graft, cut quickly two lines as you can see , then add in the middle a slit thusly.\n&gt; Figure\n&gt; at right bottom margin of folio 105r\n&gt; \n Then with the point of your pen—knife separate the bark from the tree, and open it from the slit in the middle, and having neatly lodged your graft so that nothing is sticking out, only the sprout, binding everything well and wrap the whole thing with a bit of linen or soft string. In this way, there will be nothing uncovered but the leaf, which in three or 4 days will indicate whether the graft has taken hold, by being green. Keep your graft in this way for seven or eight days. Then unwrap it, and join it to the bark, keeping the sprout itself straight, and then rewrap the whole thing gently, but not as strongly as before. And if there is any growth, leave it some room to grow and then three or four times\n\n\n  Figure\nat left bottom margin of folio 105r\n\n\n- - - - - 105v - - - - - \nThen, when the graft has taken hold, cut the top of the tree, which is above your tree, three or four fingers above the graft for the first time. Then, closer so that it serves. But be advised that when you do your initial grafting there should be no small hole at the back of your sprout, because this means that root is broken and your graft will never take. Therefore make sure the back is in tact. This type of grafting can be done from mid—May onwards, because the trees have budded and made new growth, until the beginning of August when the trees are full of sap. Almond trees which are naturally drier lose their sap earlier. Those who want to graft onto them the almond trees mericotons, apricots and nut—tree grafts, which are the best, should do so usually in January. Nut trees, such as perches mericotons should be grafted en fente. It is said that trees graft by the shield—graft method take longer to bear fruit.\n\n",

Sublimate softens it nicely. But, since it vanishes into smoke, it won’t aid you for very long. Therefore mix this mixture into it when you want to cast it: of sal ammoniac, the best verdigris that you can find, a bit of borax and some saltpeter. And this, held over the heat, will become neat. The saltpeter makes it clear and heats it. But the key thing in this mixture is the verdigris, which has to be good. This mixture softens your gold so much that it becomes as tractable as lead, even if it is good gold.\n\nFor sand for molding flowers and leaves &amp; other delicate things, mix in raw plaster, crushed brick and stone alum.\n\nTo moisten sand, spirits are excellent because it makes sand fine and leaves in a vapor when you reheat your box frame.\n\nDilute sal ammoniac is very good, is excellent for moistening sand, but for lots of water you only need a little bit of sal ammoniac.\n\nA raw lump of metal, if you don’t have crocum ferri, is good for gold.\n\nThe snakes and the lizards you wish to mold should not be kept for a long time, because if they are alive, they will waste away, and if they are dead, they will decay.\n\nPlaster of Paris is as hard as stone and very good.

Use also stone alum, half of the quantity of the tiles. Use two full pots of plaster, one pot of tile and half a pot of stone alum. Do not use too much stone alum because that binds the sand, and allow sand to withstand fire without cracking or breaking. Without it [stone alum] sand would not withstand fire, you can use it for all kind of metal, but for gold add a bigger quantity of stone alum, add also crocum ferri, because they [these filings] attract gold.\n\nAll the sands you will cast, must withstand fire very well, it must withstand high temperature without spoiling anything.\n\nIt is difficult to grind stone alum, and it cannot be sieved, you must grind it on a marble slab. The white [stone alum] powder the apothecaries sell is good, it is easy to crush it into a mortar, use the pestle slowly, that way you will make it [the stone alum] very fine.\n\nCrocum ferri must be heated into a glassworker’s furnace during four days.\n- - - - - 107v - - - - - \nMolds for fine things, like wormwood or something similar, can only be used once, dip the molds into water before breaking them. Things twice reheated are dissolve easily into water. If you don’t do that your work will be hard to be stripped of the mold without being spoiled.\n\nGood stone alum is white and as shiny as white silk, this stone alum is made of long pieces, as long as a finger, and is very fragile and woolly and fluffy. Stone alum made of stone is harder and not so good. The best quality can be found in France near Ronan. For our sand, stone alum must be crushed into a mortar, and must be ground on the marble again. Don’t even think about sieving it because this matter is fat and woolly, it wouldn’t pass through any sieve because of the very fine and soft filaments. These filaments give the sand a much greater binding effect than natural wool or even the filler the foundry owner uses for big works, because natural wool and filler burn and stone feather alum resists fire.\n\nWhen you cast surround the sand of your mold with very beaten greasy earth. Make a circle around your mold with this earth.\n\nArchanum omnibus fere reconditum est in re fusoria, v{idelicet} res exprimenda formis, sive herba sit sive animal ut lucerta, inmergatur primum in vini spiritum aprime rectificatum, deinde pulvere composito aspergatur sive illinatur (si pulvis in formam pultis redactus sit, ut assolet)\n\nWhen you want to mold something hollow, the core must be made of the same matter, if the snake or the animal is curved or folded you must do your core in several pieces.\n\nTry [to see] if distilled vinegar is good for eating away, it will dissolve the animal inside the hollow mold.\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 107v\n\n  If you know that your plaster cannot endure fire without breaking, do not take the recipe of the mixture literally, sometimes you can add less stone alum than above. Because stone alum soften molds. Once reheated do not grind the stone alum again, leave it ground as the apothecaries did. It will not prevent the cast from being neat, and will give more binder to your cast. When the mold holds the color of the brick and is reddened then it will be harder.\n\n- - - - - 108r - - - - - \nTo hold the cores, some [people] use wire made of the same metal as that to be cast because it boils down and is made similarly, but when it is melted or pliant the core varies. Other [people] find it serves them better to use sharpened iron wire about the borders because it holds more firmly, and having fine points it does not rise up any more than the point of a needle and one can apply gold or silver on this rather than putting it in works [where] one makes a hole in the work with a small chisel.\n\nSpirits prevent the sand from bubbling and do not make little holes on the borders of the mold if the thing to be molded is very damp, the holes and farts and bubbling does not make it in the place of the mold which is thick but at the borders which are more delicate.\n\nOne casts ordinary silver of the sort goldsmiths coarsely work, which is made with mediocre alloys. And when one casts with solder, it runs even better.\n\nSpalt is a whitish stone which can be found in Germany, mainly in Augsburg from which can be made the most excellent sand that can be found for [casting] lead, tin, copper, silver and gold. And the more it is used, the better it is. It is clean for casting flat things in a frame. For rounded things, it is not as attractive [because it] does not hold in the fire as the aforementioned [things] composed of plaster.\n\nThe snippings of [a] large [piece of] greasy leather are good to cast in melted copper and brass because they clean it and take away from it all its filth.\n\n",

That way, it will not bite if it cannot stretch its neck and do a sinuous turn, it will not be able to hurt from a frontal attack, nor will it be able to twist into an S. I have found out that the person who taught me how to mold them was little afraid of snakes. He would catch one and pull it quickly, grabbed it by the neck and, putting it under his shoe, flattened it so it would eject from the behind, which is five or six fingers from the tail, everything that is bad and venomous in the belly. After that, the snake has no strength to bite and, if by chance it still bites and ejects from its behind some garbage, he [the man] would dig in the soil with a knife and bury his hand in the fresh and humid soil which, applied to the infected part of the hand, would suck all the venom, without doing anything else. It was the same with toad venom, as I have seen experimented\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 110r\n\n  In three [days] it is as thin as if he had not eaten.

  content: "- - - - - 112v - - - - - \n \n\nAffixing and arranging animals\n\nHaving gotten in some fat earth called clay, that should be grey, because that is the best one, or another that will bind well and will be well prepared and beaten, so that it is malleable without being damaging your hands or the work, make a lazagne, or a pancake shape, of this clay equally flattened with a rolling pin, which pastry—makers use so that it is slightly thicker than a poulc. And on this pancake, affix your animal, making it as life—like as possible and the way in which it is naturally shaped. And firstly, with a good needle, pierce it from underneath, in the middle of the throat, up to the top bone of the head. Then take the needle out and in the hole, put the point of an iron wire, of such a length that it suffices to maintain the head of the animal as high as it must be, and if the skin gets in when you put in the wire, take it out with the edge of your small pincer, and arrange the skin as it was before. Pierce the other end of the wire in the sheet of clay. In this way the head will be held high, which will make it more graceful and proud. Arrange afterwards, the rest of the body, and the legs, and the curling as you think will look best. And so that it is secure and does not move when you put in the sand, secure the legs with little points of iron wire, having already made the first hole with a very sharp needle. Do the same on the body parts that you deem necessary, making sure that the points going through the animal are fixed in the clay sheet, and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal by a\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 112v\n\n  Take a needle of fine steel, and which will be the sharpest you can find, so that with it, when you make your first hole in order to place the wire threads, it will pass through without effort, and take care not to rudely insert the wire or take skin with it. Then put a thicker wire in the thick bits [of the animal] and the thinner wire in the thinner bits. But take this secret advice and do not plant your pointed wire in one go through the animal and onto the plaster, but having planted it, take it out of the clay earth but not out of the animal, which is afterwards fastened there. One does this because by fastening the point the first time, it pushes in the skin of the serpent and by taking the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom margin of folio 112v\n\n  When you reuse the points you have already used, make sure to clean them well of rust, so that they do not take away some skin.\n\n\n\n  at bottom margin of folio 112v\n\n  The main arrangement of your casting is to keep its head very high and have it looking sideways. For this effect, pierce the head on a solid plank or table, making the wire pass through the bottom of the throat up to the top of the head\n\n\n\n  Figure\n\n\n- - - - - 113r - - - - - \na bit so that you can take it out if you need to. And be advised that these needle points must be of the thinnest kind of iron wire, with a length that is suitable to the animal; because the smaller your needle is, the smaller the leftover hole will be. However, you must have different sized ones because there are some needles that go on the body and in places that are thicker, like under the throat, and some needles must be longer and stronger than the ones used on legs and thin places, where the needles must be subtle and thin, almost like the biggest harpsichord strings. And it would be better if they were of iron wire, which is firmer than the one made of latten. And if piece of a tail, a piece of nail or a piece of leg to the body needs to be joined to the body, do not use the needle; it would damage these parts. But apply a bit of wax, as big as a grain of millet, between the body and the end of the tail. Then with a bit of iron wire, flattened and warm, touch the wax and join the two pieces by applying a bit of pressure. In this way, after your animal has been well—placed on the lute—shaped pancake of clay earth, \n&gt; Figure\n&gt; \n build around it a wall of the same clay \n&gt; Figure\n&gt; \n in this way. And join everything together. And then with a big knife, with which you have cut the clay, take away the extraneous clay surrounding the pancake. And place on a piece at the end of the mold to close it off, as you see in B. Then, with a small curved instrument, mark on the inside of your mold the thickness you wish, which for a common serpent must be two inches thick; so that when you put in your wet sand, you will see when it is thick enough. When all of this is neatly set out, moisten well the shaped body of the animal everywhere, with good spirits, with a brush. For this is the best—kept secret: because everything that is touched by spirits will come out very neatly and without any small eyes or holes that we call bubbles, which usually come not at the back or in the thick sides of the mold, but on the edges. And as soon as you have thusly moistened everything with spirits, put in your wet sand without letting the spirits evaporate, which they do quickly. And soak it thusly and make sure the needle is as long as you need according to how much you want to raise the head, and that both ends are sharp. Having been arranged thusly, affix your serpent on the clay earth, and place the head first and then the rest.\n\n\n  Figure\n\n\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 113r\n\n  If, once you have placed you animal on sheet of clay, you are distracted with other occupations, rub your animal with spirits and under the belly so that it does not stick or attach itself to the clay earth.\n\n\n\n  Figure\n\n\n\n\n  at left bottom margin of folio 113r\n\n  If, when you pierce the belly of your animal, it releases water on the plaster, clean it well with cotton because the sand that was wet will become lumpy. If it is on top of the animal, clean it very carefully and very neatly and touch it and strongly wet it with spirits.\n\n\n",

If you want to cast lead or tin — because one would need more for casting gold or silver — having the water in your dish, add the sand and not the other way around [by adding the water to the sand], and adjust it with such attentiveness that, while mixing it vigorously and wetting it quickly with a wooden spoon, it does not become thicker than mustard. And in such a way cast [i.e., pour] first the clearest part, as is always at the surface, by shaking it a little higher in your mold. And doing so, since your animal is nearly covered, Once your animal is covered, blow on it very strongly to eliminate the small bubbles from your soaked sand.

Because the head is higher, you will have to dig deeper to expose it and do a deeper notch that has to be well exposed, by enlarging it from the outside, in order for the second mold that you cast on top of it releases well. A process for which the animal himself can be useful because his nature so permits. However, make sure that you reveal the lizard’s throat more than you would do a snake, because the lizard has big jaws and big bones that do not cast as easily, and has deep ears in which the wet sand is not as easy to remove. But you will avoid all of this if you expose half of the head and those things that you know do not release easily. When everything is well exposed, blow over it and wipe each part again with a cloth made of swine hair, slightly dampened into salt water or clear water, do that gently, that way the lower part of your uncovered animal will be very neat. # 🝋 Once it is done, dip the covered side of your mold into water for a pater noster. It will suck water inside, that way when you’ll rub with oil the uncovered side, the oil will remain on the top, and to prevent the second cast which you will cast on top from sticking. Dip your mold into water, take a particularly fine brush and rub with oil the entire mold but the animal; it should not be touched with oil. Make sure to use you brush between the parts and on all the fragile parts. And if by mistake oil is soaked, dip the mold into water, as it is said above, and drop by drop the oil will come back to the top.\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 114r\n\n  Mold small animals as big ones, however, for small animals, use very fine tacks made of cords of cittern, short and long ones.\n\n\n\n  Figure\nat left top margin of folio 114r\n\n\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 114r\n\n  remove all the little tacks with the help of very small flat pincers. # then + [illegible] # However, leave the tack which is pinned into the throat so that it will help you to turn the head over, because it is sunk deeper than any other part, because when you drew the plan, you put higher up. It is at the level of the head that you must make the biggest notch and you should start at that notch to expose and then keep following by looking at the traces left by the tacks.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom margin of folio 114r\n\n  and if a small piece of nail, or piece of tail, or other fine things separate from the mold, put a little piece of wax between them, and join them with the tip of a hot iron wire, then smooth it in your mold with a knife, and make notches on the sides in order for the other half of the mold to adhere to it. 🝋\n\n\n\n  Figure\nat left bottom margin of folio 114r\n\n\n- - - - - 114v - - - - - \nThis thus prepared, put your first half—mold on the disc of clay, surround it with a clay circle and do a thickness mark similar to the first one. Then, with a rather thick brush, wet with spirits all your animal’s exposed half, without, if possible, missing any part, because therein lies the secret to casting neatly. Then, as fast as possible before the spirits evaporate, soak your sand, and cast it, shaking, blowing, and moving the mold, as you did for the first one, making sure that what you pour first on the animal is clearer than the rest, so that it is soaked everywhere and highlights the finer parts. So, leave it for fifteen minutes so it sets, then remove the clay circle and disc. And, with a knife, join you two molds together in a longish form, like a mandore, as we say, because of how you cast. Then soak a little in water the whole mold up to the level of the joints. Because this is another secret to separate them more easily. Otherwise, you would break everything. Separate them like this skillfully. After this, gently and patiently remove half of the animal still in the mold, pulling it sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, in order to avoid breaking it, or ruining parts of the mold. The mold, being empty, rejoin both half so that no dust comes in, and put them aside until you want to heat them up, make the runners, the vents and put the clamps. As for the animal, to avoid it drying, and in order to be be able to use it to mold 4 or 5 of times, put it on water. I believe that it would be better preserved in spirits. However, it would be best to make the 4 or 5 molds the same day because these animals rot and will smell within the day. Having left your molds to dry out, for they will stay humid for at least a month, make the vents for one half.\n\n\n  Figure\nat left top margin of folio 114v\n\n\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 114v\n\n  + Note that once you have made your second casting, if you left your mold without opening it for a day or a night, you would then need to put it into hot water or reheat it, rather than open it, like for the crab.\n\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 114v\n\n  If after both halfs of the noyau have set and hardened, it would not open if you did not dip it into water. But as you dip the back of your mold into water, oil comes back to the top and touches the joints which separates them.\n\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 114v\n\n  However, be sure that your second mold is thick enough, and hard enough otherwise it could break while dipping it into water if you want to open it. To avoid this mistake dip the entire mold into water and rub it everywhere, if the mold has set enough it will harden. Then take both molds with a rough cloth, in order to grip it better. Then strongly separate the molds as if you wanted to tear bread apart. But in case it breaks, rejoin them, and fortifies the joints with clamps.\n\n\n\n  Figure\nat middle bottom margin of folio 114v\n\n\n\n\n  Figure\nat right bottom margin of folio 114v\n\n\n\n\n  at right bottom margin of folio 114v\n\n  Afterwards you can repair the mistakes with a small pair of scissors.\n\n\n",

Try to avoid that if you can, but do not give up your second casting because not much sand comes in this empty space and it will be easy to clear it with the help of a small needle, also this sand does not stick to the first cast.\n\nCasts which must be reheated, like casts for gold or silver, or other matters which must be burnt inside the mold, need more stone alum than casts which are stripped of the mold easily, like lead and tin. However do not add too much stone alum.\n\n",

Then put your molds on these charcoals —— and not on a grate as some people do —— because they would get too strong a heat. Let your furnace heat up gradually for a while, always adding burning charcoal. As long as the mold is humid, your charcoal will be dampened at the bottom, but when it is dry, the charcoals start to blaze. When one side of the mold is dry, turn over; when both sides are dry and don’t smoke anymore, increase the heat and cover your mold with burning coals.

Arrange the coal in the forge in such a way that the wind of the bellow will blow above the crusol and no on its side as it would cool it down and would not heat it enough. Also, make sure it is three good fingers away from the wall of the forge so that it is quite surrounded by coal. Allow the crusol to anneal until it is quite red. Then, have your boy strongly blow the bellow with long pushes, as in this manner it heats it better. Meanwhile, once the gold will be melted, blow a small bellow above it. Because [otherwise] the gold would turn sour and would acquire some kind of coat. As long as there will be some swirling smoke as you blow this way, it means that it is not soft enough for the cast. Therefore, uncover the melting pot and without displacing it and without stopping the bellow, tilt it towards you so you may well see what is inside. Throw a ferue of borax in it and blow wind towards it with the small bellow in a jerky fashion. Should there be coal inside, blow a bit stronger to make them come out. And if the gold still smokes and swirls, add borax again and blow above it. Beware that it is still sour and not soft enough, it will show a coat when you blow it as if it had cooled down. By contrast, if it does not show this sign, it is soft enough. Then, blow strongly so that it [the gold] is quite heated and once you think it is hot enough, throw colour on top of it in the crusol and the colour should be composed as following: verdigris, saltpeter, sal ammoniac, and a bit of borax.

Some people say that counter from Germany contain a lot of calamine. However, when they are tempered, calamine evaporates, calamine mixed with melted latten always evaporates, because latten becomes red again, thanks to the reiteration of melting. However, fresh calamine and only fresh calamine, which is blended with remelted latten, makes latten run, and allow a clean cast. Because calamine which is added to remelted latten is half—damaged compared with its natural state. This half—damaged calamine make latten porous and agitated because it has a tendency to evaporate. Thus add only very fresh calamine to melted latten. Make sure to cast your mold very hot, you mold must become red—hot, like molds to cast gold, silver, copper and metal. If you pour fresh calamine, avoid its smoke which is pernicious. To cast a medal, I took thirty counters from Germany and xii clous de rosette made of doulx latton, like for claires medals which are made of soft latten. This matter contains a lot of calamine like all kind of yellow latten, and make a lot of smoke which prevent latten from running, and make it porous, that is why it is necessary to make many vents and to cast very hot, latten must be as white as water, or as melted silver or as a polished mirror of steel. The second fusion will come out much better because evaporated calamine does not make as much smoke. If you use a molding frame that does not break and holds its own, the second [casting] will come more neatly out of the mold, because the frame is impregnated with the smoke of calamine. If you add sal ammoniac to your latten, this latten will be clear and shiny, but will be even more shiny with huile tingente. Do not use another sand than the above mentioned to mold a noyau, and the mold must become red—hot, like a mold to cast gold. Make a lot of vents. If you cast yellow latten with the prepared tutty you will not get any smoke.\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 136v\n\n  This metal is capricious to cast because of the smoke of the calamine. Do not leave it out of the fire, as some do with silver. Because when air or wind touch it, the mold gets cold at once. When you cast it, this metal always leaves burrs, like when casting glass. Foundry workers do not usually use this very yellow latten as much because of the calamine which is heated. They cast red copper and turn it yellow with fresh calamine, or with some prepared tutty. Before casting, clean it with charcoal with a quere made of copper or iron. Then cover it with a cloth soaked in lard blended with saltpetre, or sal ammoniac, in order to protect it from wind, which would cool it down.\n\n\n",

  content: "- - - - - 137v - - - - - \n\nWetting sand to mold flat medals\n\n \n Flat medals, made of wax or metal, must be oiled very lightly and then touched with a brush of spirits. So that the already moistened mold takes well the oiled thing without rejecting it, one warms the water well in order to wet the sand, because with cold water it would be rejected. It is necessary to oil medals, because they do not expand and in this way would break the mold. Animals, which expand, do not need oiling. The hot water much be of such a heat that you cannot keep your figure in it without it becoming too warm. Wet the thickest sand for flat and solid medals rather than [for] lizards and finer things. Once your sand has set, clean and scrape your mold on one side and the other, and on the bottom edge of the thrown side of the medal, make a notch so that it is easier to take out. Lower the mold, scraping what surrounds the medal, so that on all sides you can take it out easily without it damaging the mold. Then make some gashes around the first mold used to throw so that the second time that you throw in it, it will be identical to the first one, and in the same way, make a notch at the bottom of the mold, where the held of the item cast lies. Also make some [gashes] in the sides of the cast. This done, wet the back of the first mold in oiled water, and after the second casting moisten it with warm water if you have molded your medal in a noyau mold. Having done the first cast, and this one having set, cut around the edge of the medal with the point of a knife so that it comes out of the throw and is not buried in it. Then having made the second cast, and having opened your mold, take away the medal in one go, with two knife points, one on the side of the cast object and one on the side of the head, which is at the opposite end.\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 137v\n\n  Take care not to oil your medal too much because if the seeps out, it prevents the sand from serving its purpose and coming together and renders it wavy and lumpy. You must only touch the middle of the medal with the tip of your oil brush and then smear the oil everywhere.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom margin of folio 137v\n\n  Make especially sure that the throw is as wide as you can on the medal and holds it together well. The gate of your cast must always be big and always narrowing as you go towards the medal. Also do not forget to notch the gate of your cast.\n\n- - - - - 138r - - - - - \nIf you want to cast gold, silver, copper or brass, it is necessary that they be perfectly red, and fired on the inside when you cast, and perfectly reheated twice, if there is something inside to be burnt and cleaned.\n\nThe molds of animals that you burn must be reheated in such a manner that the animal burns up. But if it has big bones, it is frustrating to take out and ☿ often breaks delicate things because of its heaviness. One does not put ☿in molds that can open. It is often molds for flowers that do not open because they are cast in one go.\n\nWhen you want to reheat your molds, fix cramp—irons on the joints, so that when they reheat they will not bend, contract or break. This is done once the cast is made.\n\nThe scrapings of the mold can also be used instead of bricks after being reheated, and also the leftover bits of the mold that have already been used. You can also pat it over important things, like works in gold or silver. You can also reheat it and blend it with water diluted with sal ammoniac, like spar from Germany, and is excellent sand for box molds for all metals.\n\nThe molds with things that need to be burnt out inside them, those ones will not open until the thing that is inside is burnt, like the molds for crayfish, crab, great—horned beetles. Do not open the molds in which you will burn something, not before the thing is burnt, it could be crayfishes, crabs, stag beetles, pictures, and pieces of wax and black sulphur, which do not come out of the mold [easily].\n\nYou must not mold on brick or wood because they absorb and attract water too early, and do not allow the sand to set. The best place for [the sand] is on a fresh layers of clay. And yet, I have experienced that grey earth dries out the mold too quickly. Yellow [earth] is better.\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 138r\n\n  For medals, and flat things, the sand must be quite thick and moistened so that it sets quickly. And when the sand is thusly thick, you can shake and move the table where you mold lies, so that [the movement] makes the sand go everywhere. But when the sand is clear, as for flowers and herbs, you cannot shake it, nor can you do it when there is something attached to wax or other things which are prone to come off, such as the legs of crayfish or other similar things. And if by chance your sand is too thick, you must quickly add some water. And having put the sand in the water, examine it until it is thick on the bottom and clear on top. The clearest is thrown in immediately and then bubbles and the thickest is thrown in at the end so that it strengthens the mold.\n\n\n",

  content: "- - - - - 139r - - - - - \n\nCasting with lead and tin\n\n \n  The way I have done it  for lizards and serpents is with two ℥ of pure tin for one lb. of unrefined lead that is impure.The mold is made out of the aforementioned sand, common for all metals, when it is reheated, leave it to cool until you can put your finger in it without causing a breach in the gate of the cast. As for the lead, it is melted in a crucible with a bellows’ fire until both the crucible and the lead are red. When it gets to that state, cleanse it anew with charcoal or with a specially made scraper or with the pufts of the little bellows. This done, leave it to rest in it red state and you can even reheat it, then if you want, throw in a bit of resin to burn away the filth. However, some think it best not to put any in because it leaves filth. But when they are ready to cast, they cannot forget to also thrown in a bean—size quantity of bismuth for each pound of lead. And it must be as red as the melted metal when it enters the mold. If the mold is large, it is much better to put in in a press so that they join well and so that the lead does not come out of the mold. However, should this happen, and that for the first, second or third time your mold does not fill up, cast heartily because for as long as your metal is red it will mix and join with the other one and will come out very neatly like the main one. The same thing can be said for pure tin used for thin things. And that way for doing pure tin is one ℥ of new lead for one lb. of the former. Large molds must be put in a press held tightly between two layers of copper, and then bury the whole thing in sand, which is better than ashes, because being heavy, it will seal better. Otherwise large molds are prone to open because the metal is heavy. Some make square molds\n- - - - - 139v - - - - - \nare made of earth or blades of copper, or iron, or wood covered with white iron, in order to bury more easily these aforementioned molds between the thin sheets of copper, estric or one of iron.\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 139v\n\n  When the metal is thick, you do not need to cast as hot as when it is thin.\n\n\n\n  at top margin of folio 139v\n\n  When you melt this often, it becomes sour and fragile because it has to be cast very hot and it makes it half—calicanated.

For this effect, try paper. It it becomes brown, it is enough, and it is good for casting, but if it blackens the paper, then it is too hot.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom margin of folio 139v\n\n  If you want to cast paper with writing on it, make a mixture with half lead and half tin. As soon as it is melted, throw it between two pieces of cardboard on a flat place that is level. And with a point or gold or hard wood, engrave on the left the writing that you want. And having poured the lead onto the cardboard, press onto it the other piece of cardboard.\n\n\n",

And [take] a half quantity of ground coal and neatly sieved through a cloth or coal sleeve, using it to give some color to your wax, that would otherwise be transparent and you will not be able to see your lines as clearly. Put your wax on the coal fire to melt. And when it is well—melted and well—liquified, have, for a full eared—porringer of melted wax, as much sulphur as a large walnut. Pulverize it. Melt it over a slow fire and when it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will become too hard. But take it off and keep stirring it with a little stick and when it has finished bubbling and is as liquified as water, cast it into the wax that you will have previously removed from the fire. And mix and stir both of the them so that they join together. After stir in little by little while continuously mixing, the charcoal that has been repeatedly ground, and in this way it will be very well incorporated. This is how you will know that your wax has gone beyond its ideal heating point, it will release no more smoke, it will start to have lines appearing on the side and not in the middle, and those lines will be close to each other. If you cast too hot, you will not be able to separate your wax from your mold and it would stick to the cast. When it is at the right state, stir it with a little stick so that the pulverized charcoal is well mixed in and has not fallen to the bottom of the mixture. And in this way, throw it in your mold bit by bit and not in one go, because wax is not runny\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 139v\n\n  This black sulphured wax is for fashioning round figures that do not come out of the mold. And they need to be burned in the moule au noyau rather than be opened like the ones that have something jutting out or an intertwining of legs and arms. And this wax, thanks to the sulphur, will melt with little heat and leave without leaving any filth. If by some misfortune the crushed charcoal remains in ashes, when you open the mold and blow on it, it will come clean.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom margin of folio 139v\n\n  To make wax serpents or other things to affix to candles, it is necessary to cast them with esbaucher wax of all colors.\n\n- - - - - 140r - - - - - \nnot like other things. And for this one, you can cast two or three times until your mold is full. Now, concerning this mold of pulverized white plaster &amp; reheated in the manner of the sand from the preceding recipes, you should have made it long ago because it is used many times. But, before using it, soak it for a good hour in cold water, &amp; at a minimum, at least as long in hot water that at first is so hot that you can’t hold your finger in it. And note that it absorbs no more, but that it appears very wet overall without water seeping into it. In removing it closed from the hot water, cast your wax in such a state of heat as has been described. And neither the first nor the second casting will readily come out well, hardly, until the mold is soaked. Let it cool down before opening it so that the cast thing not break. You will know that the casting is good when the wax coming back out of the mold is thin and even. Remember to make several castings along the whole length of the mold so that in this way the wax runs better. Make the first\n&gt; Figure\n&gt; \ncasting twice as large as other molds. And if, in the first casting, your work fills with bubbles and in so doing does not come out neatly, it’s all the same, because you have to face the fact that the three or four first do not readily come out well. Firstly, you will know whether there are a few barbs that keep it from stripping well. And you will remove them if, on their own, they do not remove themselves in the two or three first castings. And the more that you cast, the more you will do it neatly. And your mold will serve you more than one hundred times if it Is well governed. But it is good to soak it one night or one day before casting so that it be well soaked. The same must be done for fruits made from sugar. This wax is very soft &amp; friendly &amp; pliant, like copper. And if it is hard [this is] because of sulfur, which makes it melt more easily than than other [wax], so much that you can see evidence on a hot slate. And the sulfur that you put inside will be found the second time that you melt it, [as] cracks on the bottom. Having in this way passed through wax, it will not catch fire at all when put to a candle. And in this case, I believe that it will cast quite the medal [illegible]. One uses the same wax in place of varnish to [illegible].\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 140r\n\n  When your animal is cast, cut away the froth &amp; superfluous things with a hot pen knife.

  title: "Casting a crayfish",
  author: null,
  layout: "narrative",
  content: "- - - - - 141r - - - - - \n\nCasting a crayfish\n\n  \n The crayfish is one of the most fantastical to cast, but also provides an example for casting other difficult things. You can distinguish males and female by the eggs that the females carry, and by the four little white back legs that males have in their tails after behind main eight legs. It is good to dry them out a bit so that the bumps come out more hard and beautiful, because none of what is made of shell shrinks. It is true that should you dry the little inside legs for too long, they become diminished and have no body. If they are too dry, the flesh separates from the scales. Be sure then to maintain the mean. They have certain hairs between the legs and at the end of the tail. And because all hair is difficult to cast, because it gets mixed up in the sand and does not release, you can burn it by putting a hot iron on the crayfish so that it the hair cannot be seen. As for animals that have hair or feathers, you must grease the hair with wheat oil, which is very dry and which will make the hair lay flat and straight. In this way, you will have form of your animal and you will have the hair. Should it the hair be wavy, it can be repaired. If your crayfish has eggs, which are delicate, and which will be difficult to take out of the mold without breaking, you would do better to make the first cast with the crayfish on its belly and eggs. In this way, you will open the mold with it the crayfish on its back, which will be hard and easy to manipulate. And the belly and the eggs will remain in the mold. And rather than opening your mold for the second time, you will have to burn it with them in it. This way, it will open easily, and what has been burned will come away cleanly. In this way, the second casting, which is done on the first one that has successfully taken hold, separates easily from the first, after having been refired. This is a singular secret for similar moldings.\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 141r\n\n  The casting is made by the very thin tail.\n\n\n\n  at top margin of folio 141r\n\n  If some little thing is missing, you can reattach it or else fill it with goldsmith’s cement.\n\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 141r\n\n  Do not forget to rub with spirits before you mold.\n\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 141r\n\n  Stag beetles, crayfish and crabs are molded in the same way.\n\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 141r\n\n  If your crayfish has no eggs, mold the back on top and the belly on the bottom. You can give it some.\n\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 141r\n\n  It the crayfish can be molded hollow for the body, but not for the legs. And for a good result, take note that the crayfish is rather fantastical to mold hollow, this ought to be reserved for turtles.\n\n\n\n  at left bottom margin of folio 141r\n\n  When you open your mold, you will find the crayfish has white bones, but they will not be powder.

If it has spawns, they will shrink while drying, and be all the more beautiful for it. Make your paste out of yellow potter’s earth, just like for the other representations. Lay your crayfish on it, the back side down, and the other parts which are more tricky to mold —— legs, belly, eggs — side up. Drive in the back side in the clay paste up to the legs, which is about the half part of the crayfish’s body. Fix the body with a pointy iron thread in the middle and, if you feel you need it, you can also drive another one at the edge of the tail. And in order that the big legs be lower than the head, which is lower because it is linked from below, add a little clay under the head. Then add a bit of clay under the jacket in order to raise it. Hide the feelers under the clay and under the crusher claws, then arrange it as you like. Stretch out the walking legs to the joints, and for the first cast, bend the second part of the walking legs. Fix the joints of the legs with wax and a warm wire so they will not move. If you want to mould something fancier, fix the end of one walking legs on the body or on a crusher claw , using the same wax. If the female has spawns, bent half the tail over the spawns, and keep the shape by fixing the tail with a wire. Be sure that you will be able to clean this part. Finally rub your crayfish with spirits, and cast your sand. Once the sand is hardened, uncover the back side, the head, the eyes, and the small legs close to the crusher claws, and the walking legs all along. One must uncover these parts as much as possible. Then bend and cover the spawns again.

But since crayfish are troublesome to burn &amp; clean, you have to uncover them as much as you can, even the little legs just until the tips, because they are troublesome &amp; if, in order to not alter them, you have to take them out, you could break something of the mold. Having uncovered it with the point of a knife, like an engraving stick or another fitting thing, clean off the sand at the joints &amp; elsewhere with your little brush really very scrupulously. And if something is loosed from the crayfish, attach it with wax, as is discussed. And also attach the horns this way. And also do the casting the length of the extremes of the little legs with wax. And refill the holes that have been made with the needles of iron wire with it. And everything being quite clean &amp; having uncovered more than half of it, oil your mold after having soaked the back side in water, &amp; do not forget to oil all the fine parts that are between the legs and the little beaks; then rub the crayfish with spirits. And do your second casting after having made the first mold even, so that the cramp—irons join better. Your mold must be larger on the side with the impression than on the back. Do not open your mold after the second casting, so that it not become clayed &amp; reheated &amp; that which is inside not be burned. Do not forget to mix crocum throughout your sand when you mold the crayfish, because you must really reheat it &amp; the crocum withstands this marvelously. To mold a crab &amp; to mold a crayfish are exactly the same. When you have uncovered your crayfish on one side do not delay at all before doing the second casting, because crayfish dry out. It is not enough to uncover the crayfish such that you see the whole half the half you uncover, but take heed that your mold, even when you are uncovering, be good and stripped, because if the crayfish gets well burnt, you will not be able to open your mold without breaking it.\n\n\n  at top margin of folio 142r\n\n  Restore it with a pen knife, little chisels, or engraving sticks.\n\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 142r\n\n  As you see here, but a wax casting all around &amp; at the end of the tail, where you will do the principal casting, two or three more.\n\n\n\n  Figure\nat left top margin of folio 142r\n\n\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 142r\n\n  Make the casting with candle wax shaped in a thread like a large packthread, the whole length from the end of the claws to the extremity of the tail.

  content: "- - - - - 162v - - - - - \n\n\nMolds of things which have not been pelted\n\nAnimals who have not been pelted can only be molded in a double mold, which can only be opened after they have been refired and after the enclosed animal is completely burnt. Animals with bones or scales which are not reducible to powder thus remain in calcined pieces which will never removed from the cast, however much bellowing or whatever amount of quicksilver is put in, or by using a feather pipe while molding to make a gate. This is why you mold in two halves: so that once the mold is opened after having been refired, the thing you’ve burnt can be cleaned out. But I advise letting it cool so that in taking off the clamps (being hot) nothing cracks while it is still fragile. While it is hot the crust and cinders which it leaves and which stick to the mold can be more easily removed when it is cold. Also note that on the side of the lower mold when you reheat the animal, which in boiling leaves a crust, in this case, always mark on the mold where the back of the animal is so that in reheating it is to the top and above and will by this method stay cleaner.\n\n",

But to remove or hide the blackness of musk, they add a bit of starch from England, which is perfectly white.\n\nTo give off a scent of white amber, in the same way that the Portuguese do, take a chunk of amber that you have broken up into pieces. Having put in a small silver porringer a spoon of flower oil, should you not have some, linseed oil. That is to say, use the type of silver spoon one might use at the table. Pour into this your ambergris, then place it on a low fire, it will melt quickly if your amber is of good quality, and there will be no lumps. Having melted it all, put in a small bit of civet, and melt it all and blend it well together. Then take your gloves which you have cleaned and dried properly, and lightly dip the edge of your finger around the edge of the oil, with patience slowly spread the oil along the glove, and rub the glove between your hands and trace along the fingers and its stitches, one after the other. Leave it to dry. Then repeat the previous procedure until you have used up all of the amber.\n\n",

Some of them are of fifteen or seventeen lb. and are loaded with two and a half lb. of grain powder, and they are put on common windows and doors. Others are of a weight of 25 to 27 lb. and are loaded with eight lb. of powder. And in such a way, they are made according to the stress they have to resist. On the outside, they are all the same shape, but in the inside, they are made like a crucible\n\n\n  Figure\n\n\n\nnarrower on the inside of the bottom and getting wider towards the mouth. And this is to reinforce the bottom, given the quantity of powder they hold, and so that they do not burst. Those of 4 s. lb. are eight lines thick at the bottom, and get thinner in the inside towards the opening, which is of 4 lines. They have xiii “poulsses” long and seven in diameter at the mouth and opening.\n- - - - - 167v - - - - - \nThe ones weighing about 27 lb. are ix “pousses” long and the mouth is 6 [pousses] in diameter. At their bottom, they are 6 “lignes” thick, and 3for the mouth. The ones weighing 17 lb are 8 “poulsses” long and the mouth is five. They are all covered together, all the forks, rods, and tools which one uses, with a big canvas or big cloth so that they do not make any noise. It is good that they sit loaded for a while. After the powder has been put in, it is grinded very hard and then tightly pressed paper is put in, then a cake of well pressed wax and, on the wax, another slab of cork that fits in very snugly and that you have to force in. In this way, the powder remains well packed and gives much greater force, and if you wish, you can put on the cork slab one of wood pierced in the middle, if the mortar has a pierced bottom, which is believed to be the easiest and which makes a greater hole because it cannot recoil. And for these that have a pierced bottom, one must have a good gimlet to first make the hole so that the rod, which is made by the point of the gimlet, has before and without noise attached the mortar. And for these, one must cover the button, which is quite sharply filed, with waxed canvas, or add wax to it so that it completely plugs the hole in the bottom. But because the doors are sometimes iron and the iron rods cannot pierce it, an iron fork made like pincers and another iron stick made with three claws, like you see painted, are use. And in this way, the mortar stays in place well and is immediately steadied. The iron rods must come out of the mortar from every point made by the gimlet, namely by three or 4 finger lengths, which all enter in the door. When the mortars are placed, the touch—hole is filled with good powder and inserted in it is a feather shaft filled with tightly pressed powder and moistened with vinegar, or if needed, the powder is firmly pressed with the palms of the hands and, having wet it with some saliva, you shape it like a cocoon or\n- - - - - 168r - - - - - \n\n  Figure\nat left top margin of folio 168r\n\n\n\nrod that we put into the touch—hole, and then, with a rope wrapped around the end of a baston, we ignite it and promptly retreat to take cover.

It is done in this way for mortars of 27 lb., but then we only put three lb. of powder. The door really needs to be strong so as not to be blown off for seventeenth lb. mortars. Some people use little bells worn by oxen or mules as an door for the mortars. Others load two canons of guns and, with a gimlet and a string, tie them with the opening against the door. If the mortars are good and do not explode, they only recoil and cannot harm if one is next to them.\n\n\n  \n    A is a small rod, hooked like the hinge of a door and made as a biron on one end in order to quickly attach a small mortar with handles of fifteen or xvii lb. for a common door or window.\n  \n  \n    B is a small mortar with handles.\n  \n  \n    C is a common mortar of 27 or 30 lb. pierced at the bottom, where a large iron rod passes, button—like on one end made like a biron on the tip so as to quickly hang the mortar against a door that will not be covered with iron plates.\n  \n  \n    D These are slabs of wax, cork and wood for loading the mortar and well packing the powder.\n  \n  \n    E iron fork made in the form of pincers as tall as a man, used to quickly set the mortar without a rod. It must be of soft iron so that the sides fold easily, if needed, and to accommodate the height or width of the door.\n  \n  \n    F is another iron fork of the same height that supports the fork made as pincers and also sustains the mortar, and with its low claw prevents the pincers from recoiling.\n  \n\n- - - - - 168v - - - - - \n\n  \n    G mortar with handles placed with its rod.\n  \n  \n    H knife—like saws to cut, if needed, a portcullis.\n  \n  \n    J the big iron rods that cross and tie the mortar.\n  \n  \n    K are like iron rods, all round and covered with cloths, like all the rest, so as to make the big iron rods, pierced close to the button, turn.\n  \n  \n    L axes that one must always carry to chop and to break, in the fortuitous case that the mortar has left anything entirely.\n  \n  \n    M a large wood mallet for knocking down what was begun and weakened by the axes and “birons”.\n  \n  \n    N are big wheelwright augers and birons for easily cutting a door or window by making large holes close to one another.\n  \n  \n    O crutches as tall as a man that must be carried to put under a portcullis immediately after the canon has been shot and to prevent the portcullis from falling.\n  \n  \n    P are small iron pincers for putting any low mortar against the bolt of a door.\n  \n\n\n",

  layout: "narrative",
  content: "- - - - - 169v - - - - - \n\n\nReducing a round form into a hollow one\n\nYou must firstly mold it with plaster as has been said before, and in the plaster throw in some wax from which will come a relief that you will repair very neatly, and will shape at your pleasure. Then you will moldthis wax relief once more in plaster, or even better with your tempered sand, #, as if for a noyau. And in the latter throw in some lead and from this you will have a very neat relief, and if it is not, repair it on cement or a similar material, and beware that it should always release well. And this one will always serve you as a model for making as many hollow molds as you would like. In this way, place half of your lead figure which you have oiled, and moisten it with spirits as we have seen above, on your clay base, then mold this half with a white plaster. Having taken hold, and having smoothed and flattened the plaster, take your black wax mixed with sulphur as we have seen before, because it leaves nothing in the mold and melts quicker. Dip it in hot urine, and once it is softened enough, make an imprint with it on your half figure in lead. And you will have a very neat hollow mold. Then adapt your wax hollow mold into a square shape, as it pleases you, as long as you have sufficient thickness, and make sure it is well even on all sides, and then mold this hollow wax; and having it imprinted on one side, and having it flat and even on the other, in the same way that you would mold a flat medal in wax or metal in a noyau. And the noyau mold will give you, whether in silver or any other metal you wish, a figure similar to the wax one, which is to say, flat and even on one side, and hollow on the other. And having cleaned this hollow, and having put it in the bleach, if it is made of silver, you can put into it some sugar work\n\n\n  at left top margin of folio 169v\n\n  Having made a hole in your clay base and having placed there your half figure in wax, oil it a bit so that it comes out more easily.\n\n\n\n  at left middle margin of folio 169v\n\n  Transparent wax is not good as opposed to one that has body, for making good imprints.\n\n\n\n  Figure\nat left bottom margin of folio 169v\n\n\n\n\n  at left bottom margin of folio 169v\n\n  Because you have molded one of your halves with plaster and wax, you can do the same thing to the other half.\n\n- - - - - 170r - - - - - \nperfume and similar things. But be sure that the black wax with which you cast is hard, so it will come off rapidly when dry so you can see if it has been stamped correctly. It can be made harder by adding more melted sulphur in the melted wax, and a bit of resin.\n\n",
